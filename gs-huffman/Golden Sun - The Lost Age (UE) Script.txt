Ages ago, or so the stories{00}
tell, the power of Alchemy{00}
ruled over the world of{00}
Weyard.{00}
-{00}
-{00}
--{00}
Alchemy wrought the base{00}
elements of humanity{00}
into thriving civilizations,{00}
like lead into gold.{00}
-{00}
-{00}
--{00}
But in time, man's dreams{00}
gave birth to untold strife.{00}
Dreams of endless riches,{00}
of eternal life, of dominion{00}
over all that lived... Dreams{00}
of conquest and of war.{00}
-{00}
--{00}
These dreams would have{00}
torn the world apart if not{00}
for a few brave and wise{00}
men, who sealed away the{00}
power of Alchemy deep in{00}
Mt. Aleph's Sol Sanctum.{00}

Prologue from Book One{00}
-{00}
-{00}
-{00}
-{00}
--{00}
The town of Vale guarded{00}
the secret for many years,{00}
until {11}{01} and {11}{06},{00}
whose parents died in a{00}
storm 3 years before,{00}
disturbed the sanctum.{00}
-{00}
--{00}
Saturos and Menardi, of the{00}
Mars Clan, followed them{00}
into the sanctum. With them{00}
traveled {11}{06}'s brother,{00}
{11}{05}, thought lost{00}
in that same tragic storm.{00}
-{00}
--{00}
Saturos and Menardi stole{00}
the Elemental Stars, the{00}
keys to breaking the seal{00}
on the power of Alchemy,{00}
and kidnapped {11}{06}{00}
and the scholar Kraden.{00}
-{00}
--{00}
If these four jewels were{00}
used to fire the elemental{00}
lighthouses, the seal on{00}
Alchemy would be broken.{00}
-{00}
-{00}
-{00}
--{00}
-{00}
{11}{01} and {11}{02} set out{00}
to stop Saturos, rescue{00}
their friends, and return{00}
the Elemental Stars to{00}
their home in Sol Sanctum.{00}
-{00}
-{00}
--{00}
They banded together with{00}
a young Wind Adept named{00}
{11}{03} and pursued Saturos{00}
and Menardi to Imil, a{00}
winter-locked town near{00}
Mercury Lighthouse.{00}
-{00}
--{00}
There, they met the guardian{00}
of the lighthouse, a Water{00}
Adept named {11}{04}. With{00}
her, they pursued Saturos{00}
to the aerie high atop{00}
Mercury Lighthouse.{00}
-{00}
--{00}
{11}{01} was too late to{00}
stop Saturos from lighting{00}
the beacon and escaping.{00}
Again {11}{01} chased him,{00}
crossing Angara to the{00}
shores of the Karagol Sea.{00}
-{00}
--{00}
Taking passage on a troubled{00}
ship, {11}{01} crossed{00}
the Karagol to Tolbi. He{00}
spoke with Tolbi's leader,{00}
a strange man named Babi.{00}
-{00}
-{00}
--{00}
Babi entered {11}{01} in{00}
Colosso as a test of his{00}
powers. {11}{01}'s Psynergy{00}
won Colosso and earned him{00}
Babi's trust. Babi revealed{00}
a great secret to {11}{01}...{00}
-{00}
--{00}
Thanks to a mystic draught{00}
from the lost land of{00}
Lemuria, Babi had lived{00}
for 150 years! He offered{00}
to help {11}{01}, who then{00}
headed deep into Gondowan.{00}
-{00}
--{00}
In the town of Lalivero,{00}
{11}{01} learned that{00}
Saturos and Menardi had{00}
kidnapped a young girl{00}
named {11}{07}, whom they{00}
needed within the lighthouse.{00}
-{00}
--{00}
{11}{01} fought and defeated{00}
them atop the lighthouse,{00}
but he was too late{B0}the{00}
beacon had been lit.{00}
-{00}
-{00}
--{00}
A great cataclysm followed.{00}
{11}{07} fell into the sea.{00}
{11}{05} jumped in to save{00}
her, but both were lost in{00}
the roiling waves. {11}{06}{00}
left the lighthouse to find{00}
them, but to no avail...{00}
-{00}
--{00}
{11}{01} went to Lalivero,{00}
where Babi asked him to find{00}
Lemuria and the remaining{00}
lighthouses. He gave {11}{01}{00}
a Lemurian ship to make the{00}
journey for the lost land.{00}
-{00}

This chapter of our story{00}
begins with {11}{06}, just{00}
before the beacon on{00}
Venus Lighthouse is lit...{00}

Fear not, none of your{03}companions is down.{02}{00}
Who shall I revive?{1E}{00}

The donation is too much?{03}Then weary wanderers{03}you shall remain.{01}{00}
Then I call upon{03}my healing powers.{01}{00}

Whom shall I cure?{1E}{00}
I require a donation of{03}{16} coin{19} to cure{03}{12}{01}, OK?{1E}{00}
You cannot cover the{03}required donation, so I{03}cannot provide a cure.{02}{00}
The donation is too much?{03}Then weary wanderers{03}you shall remain.{01}{00}
I shall apply the cure.{01}{00}
The poison has left{03}{12}{01}.{02}{00}
Cure for {16} coin{19}{00}

From whom shall I drive{03}the spirits away?{1E}{00}
A donation of {16}{03}coin{19} is needed to drive{03}spirits from {12}{01}.{01}Shall I begin?{1E}{00}
You cannot cover the{03}required donation, so I{03}cannot aid you.{02}{00}
The donation is too much?{03}Then weary wanderers{03}you shall remain.{01}{00}
Then I shall drive the{03}spirits away.{01}{00}
The spirits no longer{03}haunt {12}{01}.{02}{00}
Remove spirits for {16} coin{19}{00}

From whom shall I{03}remove the curse?{1E}{00}
Donate {16}{03}coin{19} for me to remove{03}{12}{01}{1B} curse.{01}Shall I begin?{1E}{00}
You cannot cover the{03}required donation, so I{03}cannot aid you.{02}{00}
The donation is too much?{03}Then weary wanderers{03}you shall remain.{01}{00}
Then I shall remove{03}the curse.{01}{00}
The curse has been{03}removed from{03}{12}{01}.{01}Just know that all{03}cursed gear has been{03}removed.{01}{00}
Remove curse for {16} coin{19}{00}
This ally is not cursed.{00}
Right when I saw those{03}materials, I had to work!{01}{00}
Which item needs my{03}special attention?{1E}{00}
Aren't you the ones{03}mucking about earlier?{02}{00}
No, that's no good.{03}It just has no soul...{01}{00}
It's OK if I work with{03}your {14}{01}?{1E}{00}
You want it to{03}shine, don't you?{1E}{00}
Hm... That's not right...{01}{00}
Well, hm... I wonder{03}which one...{01}{00}
Well, all right! I'm going to{03}make you something great!{02}{00}
A little elbow grease, and{03}I'll make something great!{02}{00}
Ah, so you're looking for{03}a really unique item, huh?{1E}{00}
Hey, if it ain't a'rainin',{03}I ain't a'workin'! Come{03}back when it's raining!{02}{00}
Listen up... It's a bright,{03}sunshiny day, and I'm{03}not working till it rains.{01}But I'm not just slacking{03}because it's a nice day.{03}I only work in the rain!{02}{00}
You want me to make you{03}a little something special?{1E}{00}
Well, look at that! You went{03}to get some raw materials{03}for me, didn't you?{02}{00}
Hm... Maybe I made a{03}mistake. It's hard to tell...{01}If you want good work,{03}I'll need good materials.{02}{00}
I can't wait to see what{03}I'm going to wind up{03}making with this...{01}It's funny, but I never{03}know until I actually{03}start working!{02}{00}
My wife has the item{03}I made you. She can{03}give it to you.{02}{00}
This? This is the blacksmith{03}Sunshine's smithy, the best{03}forge in Weyard!{01}But Sunshine's not taking{03}any jobs right now.{02}{00}
It takes our Sunshine a long{03}time to finish the items he{03}works on.{01}Maybe you could just...wait{03}a little while before coming{03}to pick it up...{02}{00}
Here's the item you wanted.{03}Now, about the payment...{01}We only take cash. Is that{03}all right with you?{1E}{00}
Hey, we're not a charity!{03}If you can't pay for it,{03}you don't get it!{02}{00}
Whoops! Looks like you've{03}got a full load there!{03}This'll have to wait.{02}{00}
You don't enough money!{03}What are you trying to{03}pull? I can't give you this!{02}{00}
OK, here you go!{02}{00}
Man, Sunshine would be{03}rich if he worked more.{03}What a waste...{02}{00}
Welcome, welcome! If you{03}need it, we've got it!{03}See anything you need?{1E}{00}
I'm sorry, but you don't{03}have enough money.{01}{00}
Who should I give it to?{1E}{00}
{12}{01} is carrying too{03}much already. Who should{03}I give it to?{1E}{00}
{12}{01} can't equip that.{03}Do you want it anyway?{1E}{00}
How many do you want?{1E}{00}
OK, it's all yours!{01}{00}
Do you want {12}{01} to{03}equip it now?{1E}{00}
Wow, that's great, huh?{01}{00}
Feel free to keep shopping!{1E}{00}
Come back soon!{02}{00}
Looks like {12}{01} can't hold{03}any more stuff, huh? Who should{03}I give this {14}{01} to?{1E}{00}
Which would you like to buy?{1E}{00}
Do you need anything else?{1E}{00}
Which one should I take?{1E}{00}
Should I grab another?{1E}{00}
You can't get rid of the{03}{14}{01}, so you can't take{03}anything else. Come get it later.{01}{00}
Terribly sorry,{03}but we don't carry those.{01}{00}
You're selling that many?{1E}{00}
Hm...{14}{02}...{03}Does {16} coin{19} sound fair?{1E}{00}
This is really quite a find.{03}Does {16} coin{19} sound fair?{1E}{00}
The total comes to {16} coin{19}.{03}How's that sound?{1E}{00}
That {14}{01} is a bit worn...{03}How about...{16} coin{19}?{1E}{00}
Hm...{14}{02}... How{03}does {16} coin{19} sound?{1E}{00}
OK, here's your money.{01}{00}
Well, that's the best I can{03}do. Oh well...{01}{00}
There you go...{01}{00}
I'm really not supposed to do{03}this, but I can be flexible...{01}{00}
We're out of stock on our{03}bargain buys. Check with us{03}again in the near future.{02}{00}
Ah, a bargain hunter, eh?{03}Nothing but great deals here!{01}What would you like?{1E}{00}
You need a little{03}repair work?{01}And what needs fixing, then?{1E}{00}
Terribly sorry, but we don't{03}carry {14}{01}{19}.{01}{00}
Huh-hey! There's no scars{03}on this {14}{01}.{01}{00}
Listen, about that... If you can't{03}equip that {14}{01}, then{03}we can't fix it, you know?{01}{00}
Jeez, all that nonsense, and{03}you don't have enough money.{01}{00}
Fixing this {14}{01}{03}will run you {16} coin{19}, OK?{1E}{00}
Too much for you?{03}Oh well... {01}{00}
I'll keep this for you.{01}{00}
The repair work is finished.{03}Here you go.{01}{00}
Any other repairs?{1E}{00}
Here's {14}{02} for{03}you, as a little gift.{01}{00}
Who should I give{03}the {14}{01} to?{1E}{00}

Hey, buddy, wanna{03}try yer luck at the{03}dice?{01}It's {16} coin{19}{03}to play.{1E}{00}
OK! Then take the{03}dice.{02}{00}
No? Oh, well.{03}Who's next?{02}{00}
Read the sign if ya{03}don't know the rules.{02}{00}
Hey! Ya don't have{03}enough coins! Ya gotta{03}pay to play.{02}{00}
Ya won {16} coin{19}!{03}Talk about lucky!{02}{00}
Ya lost {16} coin{19}.{03}Better luck next time.{02}{00}
Lucky Dice{01}{00}
Throw the dice on the{03}table and try to get{03}the same numbers.{01}{00}
Prizes are based on{03}the numbers rolled and{03}where each die lands.{01}{00}
The more numbers{03}that match, the more you{03}win.{02}{00}
Lucky Dice{01}{00}
If two numbers match on{03}either the dice or{03}the table...{01}{00}
it's called a pair,{03}and you don't win or{03}lose anything.{01}{00}
Two pair doubles your{03}money. Triple matches{03}triple your money.{01}{00}
Four of a kind is{03}perfect, and you win{03}five times your bet.{01}{00}
Plus, if your dice come{03}up perfect on the{03}Perfect Bonus spot{01}on the table,{03}you win an even{03}bigger bonus!{02}{00}
Ya won {16} coin{19}!{03}Talk about lucky!{02}{00}
Ya lost {16} coin{19}.{03}Better luck next time.{02}{00}
Is this yer first{03}time to play{03}Lucky Dice?{1E}{00}
Once ya start playing,{03}ya won't want to stop.{01}There's no other game{03}in all the lands that's{03}this much fun.{02}{00}
Lucky Dice is all the{03}rage in Tolbi. You can{03}play it year-round.{02}{00}
Whoa! Getting triple{03}digits is real tough!{02}{00}
I don't want to stop{03}playing Lucky Dice, but{03}I can't spend anymore!{02}{00}
Winning or losing{03}is pure luck. I ain't{03}cheatin' nobody.{02}{00}
The rules for Lucky Dice{03}ain't all that hard.{01}Ya can even learn{03}'em while ya play.{02}{00}
Sometimes, people who{03}have never played{03}Lucky Dice win the most.{01}They call that{03}beginner's luck.{02}{00}
Thinking won't help{03}you win this game.{03}When I try to think{01}about how to throw the{03}dice, I lose. Maybe{03}I think too much.{02}{00}
My luck has run out{03}for today. I better{03}quit playing.{02}{00}
Step right up{03}and try your hand at{03}lucky wheels!{02}{00}
You gotta have game{03}tickets to play.{02}{00}
You have {16}{03}game ticket{19},{03}{10}.{01}Would you like to{03}use these tickets?{1E}{00}
The rules are listed{03}on the sign. Take a{03}look, take a look.{02}{00}
You can't carry any more{03}items. Are you sure{03}you want to play?{1E}{00}
If you win anything,{03}you might not be able{03}to take it with you.{01}Is that okay?{1E}{00}
Then get rid of some{03}items and come{03}again.{02}{00}
Step right up and enjoy{03}yourself.{02}{00}
Choose how many{03}tickets you'll use.{02}{00}
Are you ready to quit?{1E}{00}
Now, we'll start{03}round {16}.{02}{00}
Congratulations!{02}{00}
You won {14}{02}!{03}Here you go.{02}{00}
And you won{03}{14}{02}!{03}Here you go.{02}{00}
Come again!{02}{00}
Too bad...{03}Come back after you{03}get some tickets.{02}{00}
Too bad...{01}Would you like to use{03}your tickets to{03}keep playing?{1E}{00}

What will you throw?{1E}{00}
You don't have any coins!{02}{00}
You have no Lucky Medals!{02}{00}
You won{03}{16} coin{19}!{02}{00}
You can't carry more items.{03}Do you still want to play?{1E}{00}

{1A}{01}: Toss{00}
{1A}{02}: Quit{00}
I get nervous when I toss{03}coins backward. I wish{03}I could face forward...{02}{00}
Why won't anyone{03}give me a Lucky Medal?{02}{00}
This is a Lucky Medal,{03}so it should be OK{03}if I miss by a bit.{01}I need all the{03}good luck I can get.{02}{00}
Hmm... I wonder if{03}these kids will take{03}all the best items...{02}{00}
Welcome, welcome, step right up!{03}Care for a round of Super Lucky{03}Dice?{1E}{00}
OK, then let 'em roll!{02}{00}
Oh really?{03}That's a shame!{02}{00}
If you want to learn about{03}the rules to Super Lucky{03}Dice, just check out the sign.{02}{00}
Super Lucky Dice{03}The Rules of the Game.{01}{00}
Throw all four dice{03}onto the table in{03}a single toss.{01}{00}
If two of the dice match,{03}it's a push, and you win{03}your money back.{01}{00}
If three of the dice match,{03}you win back twice the bet{03}you placed.{01}{00}
If you get two pairs of matching{03}dice, you win three times the{03}bet you placed. {01}{00}
If all four dice match,{03}it's a perfect toss! You{03}win eight times your bet!{01}{00}
If you get one pair, two pair,{03}three of a kind, or a perfect{03}four, you can play the hi-lo game!{01}{00}
You have to guess whether the{03}next roll of the dice will be more{03}or less than your current total.{01}{00}
If you win the hi-lo game, you{03}double your winnings! You can{03}do this up to five times.{02}{00}
So, tell me, pal... Have you{03}ever played Superdice before?{1E}{00}
Yeah, but you've never won,{03}have you? I can see it in{03}your face.{02}{00}
Now, this here's a simple game,{03}but it's my favorite dice game.{02}{00}
If you lose the hi-lo game,{03}you don't win anything...{03}It's tough to know when to quit!{02}{00}
I almost always get at least{03}one pair, but then I lose{03}everything on the hi-lo game!{02}{00}
When they lose, they call me a{03}cheater. When they win, they call{03}it skill. Really, it's all just luck.{02}{00}
It's not a tough game, not if{03}you play enough. You just{03}sorta learn as you play...{02}{00}
This kid's got unlucky written{03}all over his face.{01}One unlucky person can{03}spoil it for everyone... I hope{03}he doesn't ruin my lucky streak.{02}{00}
It's tough to know when{03}to keep playing and when{03}to cut your losses.{02}{00}
I can win, I can win, I can win!{03}Whoa! ...I'm going to lose...{02}{00}
Sorry, pal, but you've gotta{03}have more coins to play.{02}{00}

Not bad! Would you{03}like to fight{03}the next monster?{1E}{00}
Nice job! Would you{03}like to fight a{03}stronger monster?{1E}{00}

Unbelievable!!! The next{03}monster is beyond your{03}imagination!{01}You will fight, won't{03}you?{1E}{00}
It's our turn.{03}Let's go, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
Hey, {11}{05}, I'm all{03}set to show you what I've got.{02}{00}
If you want me to fight, I'll{03}do it, but don't expect anything{03}amazing from me.{02}{00}
I'll do the best I can!{02}{00}
?{00}
Hey, I'll do my best if{03}you do yours!{02}{00}
You don't even want to{03}try? I'll show you my power.{02}{00}
All right, {11}{05}, we'll{03}do it together!{02}{00}
OK, we're set, {11}{05}.{03}But remember, you're calling{03}the shots, all right?.{02}{00}
What? I have to take a break?{03}Why do I have to do that?{02}{00}
There's something really sad{03}about being told to stay behind.{02}{00}
That's fine, I could use{03}some rest anyway.{02}{00}
?{00}
OK, I'll be waiting right here.{03}Do your best, and hurry back.{02}{00}
Don't you want me with{03}you anymore, {11}{05}?{02}{00}
Are you trying to tell me{03}something, {11}{05}?{02}{00}
I'll fight enough for{03}both of us...{02}{00}
If you don't want to fight,{03}that's fine. We'll do better{03}without you, no problem.{02}{00}
Huh? No way!{03}Please fill in for me!{02}{00}
I'll do the best I can.{02}{00}
?{00}
Wait, I say I'll fight, and then{03}you back out of it? What's{03}that all about?{02}{00}
Good luck, {11}{05}!{03}If you want me, you know{03}where to find me.{02}{00}
So it's just me. Is that{03}all right? I'm a little nervous.{02}{00}
I don't care who I'm fighting;{03}I'm going to fight with{03}everything I've got.{02}{00}
I'm looking forward to finding{03}out who I'm gonna thump.{02}{00}
Now that I'm all ready to{03}fight, I'm not concerned{03}about losing at all...{02}{00}
I'm not sure if my Psynergy{03}or my weapons will give me{03}the upper hand in battle...{02}{00}
?{00}
They can send in anyone they{03}want, because I'm going to knock{03}them all down flat!{02}{00}
I hope we're fighting someone{03}big and strong. I like a challenge.{02}{00}
Whatever we face, I'm sure{03}we can deal with it.{02}{00}
I'll leave this up to you.{02}{00}
All this waiting around is{03}boring! Hurry up and clean{03}their clocks!{02}{00}
It doesn't fill me with confidence{03}to know you're not taking part.{02}{00}
I only hope everybody comes{03}through this intact...{02}{00}
?{00}
I'd be more comfortable if{03}I were out there with you.{02}{00}
If you leave me behind{03}and then lose, I'll never{03}forgive you!{02}{00}
I just hope your aim{03}doesn't falter...{02}{00}
Everybody deserves a little{03}credit for this victory!{02}{00}
You can count on me,{03}through thick and thin!{02}{00}
If I seemed nervous, it was{03}only because I wasn't sure{03}you were prepared for this.{02}{00}
I'm glad we won... But don't{03}you feel at all bad for your{03}opponents?{02}{00}
?{00}
You know, you would never{03}have won without me.{02}{00}
Yeah... That didn't offer a{03}lot of challenge.{02}{00}
I gave it my best effort,{03}as you could see.{02}{00}
Everybody did great! I didn't{03}worry at all about you!{02}{00}
You won? Without me? Wow...{03}Way to make a guy feel{03}unneeded there.{02}{00}
You really stayed cool in{03}the heat of battle. Good work!{02}{00}
The most important thing is{03}that nobody got hurt. Except{03}your opponents.{02}{00}
?{00}
Sure, you won, but...it would{03}have been a lot easier if I'd{03}been there, huh?{02}{00}
Oh, you won? Yeah, that's{03}great. But you still left me{03}behind!{02}{00}
That was a stunning battle.{03}I was on the edge of my seat.{02}{00}
Don't blame yourself... It{03}was just a bad strategy.{02}{00}
Pull yourself together! We'll{03}do it next time.{02}{00}
You should have picked{03}someone else. It's all my{03}fault that we lost.{02}{00}
I didn't help out very much,{03}did I? I'm sorry...{02}{00}
?{00}
Wow. That was a serious{03}beating... What happened to us?{02}{00}
I was doing my very best.{03}I certainly hope you were, too.{02}{00}
Maybe it would have been{03}better if I just hadn't come...{02}{00}
You win some, you lose some.{03}That's the nature of competition.{02}{00}
What? You lost? That's what{03}you get for leaving me out!{02}{00}
It's not a problem, {11}{05}.{03}You'll do better next time.{02}{00}
I know I wasn't out there with{03}you, but...I still blame myself.{02}{00}
?{00}
Of course, you're going to{03}lose if you have such an{03}awful attitude about it!{02}{00}
If you'd taken me with you,{03}none of this would ever have{03}happened. Don't you forget it.{02}{00}
You should have asked for{03}my help. From the look of{03}things, you could have used it.{02}{00}
I'm just going to watch.{03}But you guys are going{03}to battle, aren't you?{01}Well, do your best.{02}{00}
{09}{04}I don't have the guts to fight{03}in the battle arena. I'll just{03}be sitting here, if that's OK.{02}{00}
You look a little scrawny,{03}but guys like you are often{03}surprisingly strong...{02}{00}
Fighting a guy with a build{03}like that would really wear{03}me out! Whew!{02}{00}
I'll be rooting for you!{03}Do your best!{02}{00}
I like my men macho.{03}You...don't work out{03}much, do you?{02}{00}
Hm... It comes in like this...{03}Then you do this, and...{03}Whoa, that's not right...{02}{00}
You could use Psynergy, Djinn,{03}even summons and items! There{03}are a lot of battle strategies...{02}{00}
So you win against one guy,{03}and then you lose against{03}the next.{01}Depending on the foe,{03}you've got to change up{03}your tactics.{02}{00}
I need to find a way to get{03}stronger, but I'm just out of{03}ideas. Maybe a nice smoothie?{02}{00}
Sometimes, your class changes{03}when you unleash a Djinni.{01}You need to watch that, because{03}it can get you into some real{03}trouble if you're not careful.{02}{00}
Should I enter or not?{03}I'm so stressed about this...{02}{00}
It looks like this is{03}your first time here.{01}I will teach you{03}what it is like to{03}fight in a battle.{02}{00}
You've won {16}{03}Linked Battle{19}. Keep up{03}the good work!{02}{00}
It looks like this is{03}your first time here.{01}You can ask me about{03}the results of your{03}battle. Okay?{02}{00}
You've won {16}{03}Linked Battle{19}.{01}Check the board on{03}the wall for the best{03}records so far.{02}{00}
Up to three allies{03}can fight in Linked{03}Battle finals.{01}The results vary greatly{03}depending on who you{03}set what Djinn to.{02}{00}
That was a great{03}battle..{03}What excitement!{02}{00}
Too bad. Sometimes, you{03}have to be lucky to win.{03}Don't be too disappointed.{02}{00}
Is this the Battle Arena{03}the old man spoke of?{03}I thought it was a{01}story of dreams. Or is{03}this the old man's{03}dream?{02}{00}
Wow... You guys.{03}You are much stronger{03}than you look.{02}{00}
What happened, you guys?{03}Try harder.{02}{00}
You look a little scrawny,{03}but guys like you are often{03}surprisingly strong...{02}{00}
Fighting a guy with a build{03}like that would really wear{03}me out! Whew!{02}{00}
I'll be rooting for you!{03}Do your best!{02}{00}
I like my men macho.{03}You...don't work out{03}much, do you?{02}{00}
Hm... It comes in like this...{03}Then you do this, and...{03}Whoa, that's not right...{02}{00}
Hm... It comes in like this...{03}Then you do this, and...{03}Whoa, that's not right...{02}{00}
Hm... It comes in like this...{03}Then you do this, and...{03}Whoa, that's not right...{02}{00}
I am a traveling warrior.{03}I came here to become{03}stronger...{01}Listen to me on{03}this: Don't underestimate{03}the monsters here...{02}{00}
You aren't too bad.{03}But don't become too{03}arrogant from this{01}victory. Continue to{03}train yourselves.{02}{00}
You have to train more.{01}Put your heart into{03}it when you fight.{02}{00}
I will tell you your{03}total wins when you{03}finish the linked finals.{02}{00}
I will tell you your{03}consecutive wins when{03}you finish the finals.{02}{00}
You've won {16}{03}consecutive Monster{03}Battle{19}.{01}Keep up the good work!{02}{00}
I can't wait to see how{03}many Monster Battles{03}you win.{01}I'll be counting{03}your victories!{02}{00}
Up to three allies{03}can fight in the{03}linked finals.{01}There are four in your{03}party, so the rightmost{03}ally will have to pass.{02}{00}
Up to three allies{03}can fight in the{03}linked finals...{01}So all of you can{03}fight!{02}{00}
You can change the order{03}of your party in the{03}status screen.{01}But you knew that, right?{02}{00}
Up to three allies can join{03}you in a Link Mode battle.{01}Your party has eight allies{03}total, so only the three allies{03}on the left of the list can fight.{02}{00}
In the linked finals, you{03}can't delay after your{03}opponent selects a move.{01}If you don't choose your{03}command within 15 seconds,{03}you automatically defend.{02}{00}
Monster Battle rules say{03}you all must fight as a{03}team against a monster.{01}If you're fighting as a{03}team, you can use the{03}same tactics...{01}you used in your travels.{02}{00}
So you win against one guy,{03}and then you lose against{03}the next.{01}Depending on the foe,{03}you've got to change up{03}your tactics.{02}{00}
You could use Psynergy, Djinn,{03}even summons and items! There{03}are a lot of battle strategies...{02}{00}
Should I enter or not?{03}I'm so stressed about this...{02}{00}
To use Summon quickly,{03}Djinn must be on{03}standby.{01}But to improve your class,{03}Djinn must be set...{03}Hmm... Choices, choices...{02}{00}
Do you put Djinn on{03}standby before a battle,{03}or do you set them?{01}I usually set them to{03}raise my class before{03}I fight.{02}{00}
Remove Djinn you rarely{03}use so you can{03}summon quickly.{01}I'm impatient, so I{03}prefer to fight in{03}short battles.{02}{00}
Sometimes, your class changes{03}when you unleash a Djinni.{01}You need to watch that, because{03}it can get you into some real{03}trouble if you're not careful.{02}{00}
All the warriors are{03}impressive, so I get edgy{03}before battles begin.{02}{00}
I could enter, but I'd{03}just get hurt if I{03}did... That'd be stupid.{02}{00}

{11}{01} and his friends{03}must have been{03}nearby, too.{02}{00}
They probably were...{02}{00}

{09}{04}YARG!{07}{02}{00}
{09}{04}What are you doing???{07}{02}{00}
Are you sure we should{03}be leaving like this?{02}{00}
Once we go down those{03}stairs, we can't get back{03}into the lighthouse.{02}{00}
Maybe I should have{03}stopped my brother...{02}{00}
{11}{06}, is something{03}troubling you?{02}{00}
I just...{02}{00}
What is it? What's wrong?{02}{00}
I have a bad feeling...{01}Like something terrible{03}is going to happen.{02}{00}
How unlike you, {11}{06}.{02}{00}
Surprised to see me?{02}{00}
A-Alex...{03}Were you listening?{02}{00}
Where's {11}{05}? Why isn't{03}he here with you?{02}{00}
My brother?{03}He left us.{02}{00}
What can {11}{05} possibly{03}be thinking?{02}{00}
He was worried about {11}{07}.{03}He went to check on her.{02}{00}
He was supposed to be{03}leading you out of here!{01}I thought you would have{03}been far from this lighthouse{03}by now.{02}{00}
Why are you still here?{02}{00}
We tried to stop {11}{05} from{03}going back up to the aerie.{02}{00}
How like him. Once {11}{05}{03}gets an idea into his head,{03}he rarely changes his mind.{02}{00}
Alex, what were you talking{03}about just now?{02}{00}
What did you mean when{03}you said...{01}"How unlike you"?{02}{00}
I was{05} merely surprised{03}to hear you expressing{03}such concern, {11}{06}.{02}{00}
Nevertheless, I'm impressed{03}{11}{05} went back...{02}{00}
Don't change the subject,{03}Alex! What did you mean!?{02}{00}
Are you saying that{03}I'm insensitive!?{02}{00}
If that's what you heard,{03}then I must have misspoken.{03}Accept my apologies.{02}{00}
Well, {11}{06}, I think{03}Alex has said his piece{03}on the matter...{02}{00}
I'm not sure he has,{03}Kraden.{02}{00}
Who do you think you are,{03}talking to me like that!?{02}{00}
I retract my statement,{03}my dear. Forget all about{03}it, {11}{06}.{02}{00}
So tell me about this{03}"feeling," {11}{06}...{02}{00}
I'm just...{05} I'm not sure we{03}should be leaving Venus{03}Lighthouse yet...{02}{00}
What are you saying?{02}{00}
You can't really mean{03}to remain here...{02}{00}
Alex is right. It's far too{03}dangerous, {11}{06}.{01}We would only hinder{03}the others...{02}{00}
The others? Did {11}{01}{03}follow us to the{03}lighthouse?{02}{00}
It would seem so.{02}{00}
He must be trying to stop{03}Saturos and Menardi!{02}{00}
If my brother goes back and{03}finds {11}{01}, they're going{03}to end up fighting.{02}{00}
If the Venus Lighthouse{03}has not yet been lit,{03}yes. They will fight.{02}{00}
{11}{05} is a terribly rash{03}young man, is he not?{02}{00}
Why are boys{03}such fools?{02}{00}
He may be rash, but {11}{05}{03}is no fool.{01}His good qualities outweigh{03}his bad...{02}{00}
That's why I think{03}{11}{01} would understand{03}if we just talked to him.{02}{00}
Why didn't I think of this{03}before now?{02}{00}
Please...{03}Can't we go back up{03}and talk to {11}{01}?{02}{00}
I'm afraid that's{03}not possible.{02}{00}
Alex, why?{02}{00}
He is an enemy.{02}{00}
{11}{01}? An enemy?{02}{00}
Our methods may differ,{03}but you and I ultimately{03}want the same thing...{02}{00}
To light the elemental{03}lighthouses...{02}{00}
{11}{01} and his friends{03}would prevent this from{03}happening.{02}{00}
So that makes them enemies?{02}{00}
But fear not...{03}They won't be able to defeat{03}Saturos and Menardi.{02}{00}
So... {11}{05} went back to{03}the top of the lighthouse?{02}{00}
Why do you seem so{03}pleased, Alex?{02}{00}
Why shouldn't I be? After all,{03}the lighthouse will soon shine{03}brightly once again!{02}{00}
Alex, why do you want{03}to see the beacon lit{03}so badly?{02}{00}
Oh, so it's my turn to answer{03}questions, is it?{02}{00}
Once, Alchemy was commonplace{03}throughout this world...{02}{00}
With its power, mankind worked{03}wonders across the land...{02}{00}
The lost age of man...{02}{00}
I want to see that world{03}restored once again, and...{02}{00}
And what, Alex?{02}{00}
We've spoken long enough{03}already. Let us continue{03}this another time.{02}{00}
We should leave the{03}lighthouse now, before{03}the beacon is fired...{02}{00}
I concur... Let's meet at the{03}location we agreed on{03}and wait for {11}{05}.{02}{00}
All right, Kraden,{03}let's go.{02}{00}
No, {11}{06}, not{03}that way.{01}We must get away from{03}the lighthouse.{02}{00}
The chest was already open.{01}But it looks like there's{03}still {14}{02} inside!{02}{00}
You found {14}{02}.{01}It looks like there's also{03}{14}{02} inside.{02}{00}
There they are!{03}Get 'em!{02}{00}
Iodem sent us to stand{03}guard here, but...{02}{00}
I never thought we'd{03}actually run into them!{02}{00}
Scoundrels! What have you{03}done with {11}{07}?{02}{00}
Return her now, or you're{03}really going to regret it!{02}{00}
Um...{05} Aren't there supposed{03}to be more of them?{02}{00}
Huh... Maybe they're just the{03}first ones to come out...{02}{00}
Great! That means we've{03}got 'em outnumbered!{02}{00}
We can probably take{03}'em, you think?{02}{00}
Go fetch the other Tolbi{03}soldiers still stationed{03}in Lalivero...{02}{00}
Yes, sir!{02}{00}
And we'll go tell the guys{03}in the caves!{02}{00}
Got it, Boss!{02}{00}
How unfortunate... It looks{03}like an ambush. What should{03}we do, {11}{06}?{02}{00}
What do you mean? Look{03}around... We'll have to{03}fight them!{02}{00}
Are you serious?{02}{00}
{11}{06}, are you really prepared{03}to fight these men?{02}{00}
We don't have any other{03}choice. We have to...{02}{00}
Well, then. Allow me to{03}shoulder some of your{03}burden.{02}{00}
...Burden?{02}{00}
We regroup along the road{03}leading away from Lalivero.{03}Do you understand?{1E}{00}
You don't need to remind us,{03}Alex. We know the place.{02}{00}
It's quite simple, {11}{06}.{03}The meeting place is in the{03}direction opposite Lalivero.{02}{00}
Follow this road west, and{03}take the path down through{03}the canyon to the cave.{02}{00}
On the other side of that{03}cave, you will find a small{03}peninsula called Idejima.{01}We meet there.{02}{00}
Thankfully, only those{03}workmen block your route.{02}{00}
And fortunately...{02}{00}
They don't look too tough...{02}{00}
Hello! We can hear you!!!{02}{00}
That's just plain rude!{02}{00}
Why don't the two of you{03}escape and leave the Tolbi{03}soldiers to me?{02}{00}
The two of us? Alone?{02}{00}
You can use Psynergy,{03}can't you, {11}{06}?{02}{00}
Um... Yes.{02}{00}
Then you'll be fine.{02}{00}
We shall reconvene{03}at the peninsula.{02}{00}
You think you can take on{03}Tolbi's finest on your own,{03}little man?{02}{00}
I do not wish to inflict{03}unnecessary bloodshed.{02}{00}
Don't wish to...{05}{03}What's that supposed{03}to mean?{02}{00}
If you lay a hand on these{03}two, I assure you that you{03}will be made to regret it.{02}{00}
By advancing, I assume you{03}mean to fight. Permit me{03}to strike the first blow.{02}{00}
What was {09}{04}that{07}!?{02}{00}
I don't know, but whatever{03}he did, it's out of our{03}league!{02}{00}
You guys deal with him{03}until backup arrives!{02}{00}
Oh, so you're next?{02}{00}
Hey, no need to{03}worry about us!{02}{00}
We're not soldiers...{03}We're not anybody!{02}{00}
Seriously, there's no{03}way we're gonna face{03}off against you.{02}{00}
Let's get outta here!{02}{00}
How undignified...{03}and how shameful.{02}{00}
{11}{06}, now is your{03}chance. Go to Idejima{03}and wait for me.{02}{00}
I'm not finished{03}with you yet.{02}{00}
You mentioned backup{03}from Lalivero?{02}{00}
Let's go meet them{03}together, shall we?{02}{00}
Hey, pal! When they{03}get here, you'll really{03}be in for it!{02}{00}
Do you honestly believe{03}that even a hundred of{03}you could stop me?{02}{00}
How amusing...{03}This I must see.{02}{00}
They're gone...{02}{00}
Come on, {11}{06}...{03}Let's be going.{02}{00}
There's nothing standing{03}in our way now!{02}{00}
But...{02}{00}
What is it now?{02}{00}
Ah... You're worried about{03}hurting any innocents?{1E}{00}
Well, just try to hold back{03}when you're fighting.{02}{00}
Oh. You must be concerned{03}about {11}{05}. We can't do{03}anything to help him here.{02}{00}
Let's get going!{03}To the peninsula!{02}{00}
{11}{06}... Are...{03}Are you all right?{02}{00}
Ah, {11}{06}...{03}You're awake.{02}{00}
Can you stand?{02}{00}
It's a good thing I came{03}back for you two...{02}{00}
Perhaps you ought to{03}come with us this time...{02}{00}
No. Someone has to keep{03}Tolbi's soldiers at bay.{02}{00}
I'll have to go to Lalivero{03}and confront them there.{02}{00}
We'll meet at Idejima.{02}{00}
He's gone again.{02}{00}
And we'd best be{03}going as well...{02}{00}
{11}{06}, escape{03}to the boat!{02}{00}
Why do I gotta be the{03}one to wait for backup!?{02}{00}
Yaaah! P-P-Please!{03}Just let me go, and...{03}Hey!{02}{00}
That scary guy with the{03}blue hair's not with you...{02}{00}
Great! Now, you'll see{03}what I'm really made of!{02}{00}
Ugggh. I can't believe I{03}got beaten by a girl...{02}{00}
Waahhh! It's them!{02}{00}
Whoa there... Where'd the{03}blue-haired guy go?{02}{00}
Who cares! I can handle{03}some girl and her grandpa!{02}{00}
Ooooog. Maybe I shouldn't{03}have underestimated her...{02}{00}
Ha! That was a good idea,{03}waiting here for 'em!{02}{00}
You two aren't going{03}anywhere!{02}{00}
Except with us, back{03}to Master Iodem!{02}{00}
Maybe I should have{03}eaten a bigger breakfast.{02}{00}
All right, so maybe you{03}are going somewhere{03}after all...{02}{00}
Oh, man... There goes{03}my big promotion...{02}{00}
My! That was invigorating!{03}He wasn't too strong...{02}{00}
I never knew fighting could{03}be so fun!{05} Ah, but we'd better{03}get on to the peninsula...{02}{00}
Not that way, {11}{06}!{03}The meeting spot{03}is west of here.{01}We must go down that{03}road and into the hills.{02}{00}
Not that way, {11}{06}!{03}The meeting spot{03}is down this way.{01}We must climb down here{03}and go into that cave.{02}{00}
There are words carved{03}into the relief...{01}If ye seek to climb{03}Venus Lighthouse, first{03}seek the power within.{01}To obtain this power, see{03}with the eyes of truth.{03}Then the way shall open.{01}But the path I reveal is{03}not the beginning.{01}The true beginning lies{03}down ancient pathways{03}on distant soils.{02}{00}
The true road can only{03}be known by he who bears{03}a true heart.{02}{00}
This is the place,{03}isn't it?{1E}{00}
The peninsula at the end{03}of the road to the west...{03}That's what he told us.{02}{00}
This must be Idejima!{02}{00}
Hm... Menardi said a ship{03}would be here...{02}{00}
We ought to see if{03}we can find it.{02}{00}
{11}{06}, it's over here!{02}{00}
At first glance, it seems{03}like a normal ship, but...{02}{00}
There's something {05}odd{03}about it...{02}{00}
Kraden, wait! Oh, I swear!{03}You're like a kid with a{03}new toy!{02}{00}
Hurry up in there!{02}{00}
What's wrong?{02}{00}
It's missing...{02}{00}
Hm? What are you{03}talking about?{02}{00}
The thingie...{03}that makes it go.{02}{00}
What do you mean? What's so{03}important about this...thingie?{02}{00}
The boat can't move without it...{02}{00}
That Menardi!{03}She tricked us!{02}{00}
Tricked us?{02}{00}
Yeah, by passing this{03}dud boat off on us!{02}{00}
There's no trick. If this{03}boat is a dud, how did it{03}get here in the first place?{02}{00}
Oh, right.{02}{00}
It must have been{03}the orb...{02}{00}
What orb?{02}{00}
Don't you remember that{03}crystal Saturos was{03}carrying?{02}{00}
That big, black pearl thing?{02}{00}
I'm certain he said he{03}could move the ship{03}with it.{02}{00}
{11}{06}, Kraden!{02}{00}
There you are.{02}{00}
I see you've found{03}the boat.{02}{00}
We set sail as soon as the{03}beacon has been fired,{03}correct?{02}{00}
Strange...{02}{00}
What is it?{02}{00}
The beacon...{03}It hasn't been lit yet.{02}{00}
You're right...{03}Why is it taking so long?{02}{00}
And why hasn't my{03}brother returned?{02}{00}
They've done it, {11}{06}!{03}They've lit the beacon!{02}{00}
What's happening, Kraden!?{03}Why won't the ground stop{03}shaking?{02}{00}
Strange... I think it might{03}actually be getting worse!{02}{00}
I think the lighthouse is{03}collapsing! Look! The ground{03}around it is crumbling!{02}{00}
Mercury Lighthouse didn't{03}react this way... What{03}makes Venus different?{02}{00}
That last tremor tore a{03}rift in the Suhalla Range!{02}{00}
How are we going to get{03}back to Gondowan now!?{02}{00}
Idejima... It's drifting away{03}from the mainland!{02}{00}
But...what will{03}happen to us?{02}{00}
Oh, Kraden... How long{03}will this island{03}continue to drift?{02}{00}
I don't know...{03}I wish you could{03}tell me.{02}{00}
Sheesh... You're no help{03}in times like this.{02}{00}
Hey, I'm hungry...{02}{00}
How can you even{03}think about food?{02}{00}
I wonder what happened{03}to my brother...{02}{00}
I can't be certain,{05} but{03}it looks like they lit{03}the Venus beacon.{02}{00}
Yeah, I know. You don't have to{03}tell me that. That's how we{03}wound up adrift at sea, right?{02}{00}
My, aren't you cranky{03}today, {11}{06}!{02}{00}
Well,{05} I suppose you're{03}just worried about{03}{11}{05}.{02}{00}
{11}{01} and the others{03}must have been at the{03}lighthouse, too.{02}{00}
I suspect you're right...{02}{00}
I miss them...{03}{11}{01}... {11}{05}...{02}{00}
Come with me.{02}{00}
There is something I wish{03}to show you.{02}{00}
{11}{05}... {11}{07}...{00}
{11}{07}! {11}{05}!{00}
They... {05}They're alive...{02}{00}
They're really alive!{02}{00}
What is this?{03}Alex, what happened?{02}{00}
I thought {11}{05} and{03}{11}{07} were still{03}inside the lighthouse.{02}{00}
It's miraculous...{02}{00}
Miracle or no, I'm just{03}happy my brother's alive.{02}{00}
What happened back there?{00}
...{00}
{11}{07}...{02}{00}
{09}{04}Oh...{07}{02}{00}
Thank the elements,{03}she's awake!{02}{00}
{11}{07}, are you all right?{03}It's me, {11}{06}.{02}{00}
{11}{06}?{02}{00}
What...happened?{02}{00}
It seems you drifted{03}here with {11}{05}.{02}{00}
With {11}{05}...?{02}{00}
Take your time... Do you{03}feel all right, {11}{07}?{02}{00}
Where are we?{02}{00}
Idejima. We were all to{03}meet here...{01}But now, the island is{03}floating away from Gondowan.{02}{00}
This island is{05} moving?{02}{00}
I know it must be very{03}hard to believe, {11}{07}.{02}{00}
When the Venus Lighthouse{03}was lit, a massive tremor{03}tore us off the continent...{02}{00}
The ground beneath the{03}lighthouse roiled, as though{03}it might crumble away.{02}{00}
I remember now...{03}And that's what carried{03}us away from Gondowan.{02}{00}
But what happened to{03}you, {11}{07}?{01}You were in the sea,{03}and Saturos{B0}{02}{00}
Saturos and Menardi{03}are gone...{02}{00}
What do you mean?{02}{00}
Another group came...{03}They fought Saturos and{03}Menardi and won.{02}{00}
Was it {11}{01}?{02}{00}
{11}{01}...{03}Yes, I think that's what{03}they called him...{02}{00}
You expect me to believe{03}{11}{01} and his companions{03}defeated Saturos and Menardi?{02}{00}
Have they really grown{03}so powerful in so short{03}a time?{02}{00}
But how did you wind{03}up in the sea?{02}{00}
When the beacon was lit,{03}the earthquake knocked me{03}off the lighthouse tower.{02}{00}
Then what's my brother{03}doing here?{02}{00}
He tried to save me{03}from drowning...{02}{00}
{11}{05} jumped from the top{03}of the lighthouse!?{03}Dear me!{02}{00}
{11}{05}...{03}are you awake?{02}{00}
Ah! {11}{05}, you're awake!{02}{00}
Brother...{02}{00}
Are you sure you should{03}be standing?{02}{00}
You don't seem very{03}surprised to find yourself{03}on a floating island.{02}{00}
{11}{05}, once you'd saved{03}{11}{07}, you must have{03}swum out here, correct?{02}{00}
You must have seen that{03}this island was floating{03}when you were swimming.{02}{00}
But what do we do now?{02}{00}
I have no idea. Nobody{03}knows what lies beyond{03}the Eastern Sea.{02}{00}
Unfortunately, I am a{03}student of Alchemy,{03}not geography...{02}{00}
What is it...Alex?{02}{00}
What's the matter?{02}{00}
Can't you see it?{02}{00}
It's land! An island!{02}{00}
It's a little...{03}big for an island.{02}{00}
That's no island...{03}It's a new continent!{02}{00}
We're saved!{02}{00}
So it would seem...{02}{00}
Wait...{02}{00}
What is it?{02}{00}
We're going to pass north{03}of the continent...{02}{00}
She's right!{02}{00}
I don't think we're going{03}to make it!{02}{00}
Oh, Kraden... {11}{05}...{03}What are we going to do?{02}{00}
???{02}{00}
Oh... This can't be good.{02}{00}
What...is it?{02}{00}
It's...a tidal wave.{02}{00}
A tidal wave?{02}{00}
The earthquake must{03}have caused it!{02}{00}
Oh... Oh my... It's{03}coming right at us!{02}{00}
Alex... How can you{03}stay so calm at a{03}time like this?{02}{00}
At times like this, where{03}would be the good in{03}panicking?{02}{00}
We'll be washed away!{02}{00}
Help!!!{02}{00}
Do you want to check{03}yourself for injuries?{1E}{00}
Looks like the arms are{03}still attached. That's a{03}good start.{02}{00}
The legs are working{03}fine, too.{05} Yup. You're fine!{02}{00}
You walk around a bit,{03}and everything seems fine.{02}{00}
Oooog...{02}{00}
Oh... {11}{05}...{02}{00}
Ouch...{02}{00}
That was quite a blow...{02}{00}
What happened when{03}that wave hit?{02}{00}
{11}{05}, look!{02}{00}
That wave carried us{03}to the continent!{02}{00}
We've hit solid land!{03}Let's go, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
Kraden has joined{03}your party.{02}{00}
What...{02}{00}
What am I doing{03}down here?{02}{00}
Oh... I must have blacked{03}out when the wave hit...{02}{00}
Hey! We've hit land!{02}{00}
That wave must have{03}carried us here! What luck!{02}{00}
Have you checked everyone{03}else? Are they all right?{1E}{00}
Great! Then let's go!{02}{00}
{11}{06} has joined{03}your party.{02}{00}
Then let's go find them{03}and get off this island!{02}{00}
{11}{06} has{03}joined your party.{02}{00}
Ohhh...{02}{00}
Nnng.{02}{00}
The wave!{02}{00}
What happened to{03}the tidal wave?{02}{00}
I thought we were done{03}for, but we're all fine...{02}{00}
And we've run aground!{02}{00}
That tidal wave turned out{03}to be a stroke of luck!{02}{00}
I wonder where we are...{02}{00}
We should take a look around!{02}{00}
{11}{07} has{03}joined your party.{02}{00}
Hey, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
You weren't planning on{03}leaving me, were you?{02}{00}
Hm?{02}{00}
Well! It's land!{02}{00}
The wave carried us{03}back ashore!{02}{00}
I assume you merely...forgot{03}about me in your excitement?{02}{00}
Understandable, but you{03}should have waited for{03}me, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
Nevertheless, let us{03}be on our way!{02}{00}
Kraden has{03}joined your party.{02}{00}
I can't believe you two!{02}{00}
How could you!?{02}{00}
Leaving me on that island{03}while you go off exploring{03}on your own!{02}{00}
And here I was, looking{03}everywhere for you!{02}{00}
I'm sorry, my dear...{03}Can you ever forgive us?{02}{00}
Oh...{05} All right. Just don't{03}leave me alone like that{03}again...{02}{00}
Anyway, look!{03}That wave must have carried{03}us to a new continent!{02}{00}
Let's go exploring!{02}{00}
{11}{06} has{03}joined your party.{02}{00}
Wa-Wait!{02}{00}
Aren't you worried about{03}me in the slightest?{02}{00}
Did you rescue me from the{03}lighthouse just to leave me{03}for dead on this island?{02}{00}
Now, I'm sure he meant{03}to do no such thing...{02}{00}
I wonder...{02}{00}
Oh, don't give me that{03}sad face... You know I{03}can't stay mad at you...{02}{00}
After all, you did save{03}me, {11}{05}. I won't{03}soon forget that...{02}{00}
But don't leave me behind{03}like that again, OK?{02}{00}
So that big wave pushed us{03}aground? Way to go, Nature!{02}{00}
What's out here, anyway?{02}{00}
That's what we were{03}about to find out!{02}{00}
Let's get started, then!{02}{00}
{11}{07} has{03}joined your party.{02}{00}
By the way...{03}Where has Alex gone?{02}{00}
He doesn't seem to be{03}anywhere on the island.{02}{00}
You don't think he set{03}out on his own, do you?{1E}{00}
Then I guess there's no{03}reason to look for him here.{02}{00}
Well, he's no longer on{03}Idejima, at any rate.{02}{00}
He might have gone{03}to look for a ship.{02}{00}
Alex wants a ship?{02}{00}
Did you forget what{03}he was saying?{1E}{00}
He wants to return Alchemy{03}to its former place in the world.{02}{00}
Then you know he wants{03}to restore Alchemy to the{03}world.{02}{00}
By lighting the four{03}elemental lighthouses, he{03}might just succeed.{02}{00}
But why the ship?{02}{00}
The remaining two{03}lighthouses are{03}unreachable by land.{02}{00}
None remain to be lit{03}across the Eastern Sea.{02}{00}
So what should we{B0}{02}{00}
We must go to the Great{03}Western Sea...{02}{00}
The Western Sea...{02}{00}
Is that where we're going,{03}{11}{05}?{1E}{00}
Well said, {11}{05}!{03}And go there, we shall!{02}{00}
Don't be foolish, {11}{05}.{03}We must pursue Alex.{03}We have to go there...{02}{00}
That's right! Our parents'{03}lives depend on it!{02}{00}
What about you, {11}{07}?{02}{00}
What do you mean?{02}{00}
It's...not going to be{03}an easy trip.{02}{00}
And there is no reason you{03}should have to face that{03}danger... Right, {11}{05}?{1E}{00}
Then you should know my{03}reason for traveling with{03}all of you, {11}{05}...{02}{00}
{11}{05} remembers...{03}I have a reason to be{03}traveling with you...{02}{00}
What do you mean,{03}{11}{07}? What reason?{02}{00}
It's{05} my destiny...{02}{00}
This quest is your...{03}destiny?{02}{00}
And you couldn't tell us{03}about this earlier?{02}{00}
But how can we trust{03}you when we don't know{03}why you're with us?{02}{00}
I'm sorry... But please,{03}you have to take me!{03}You must! You need me!{02}{00}
I don't understand.{03}Why exactly do we{03}need you?{02}{00}
You know that I am{03}an Adept, don't you?{02}{00}
I can control the wind,{03}as {11}{05} already{03}knows...{02}{00}
You knew that she{03}was a Wind Adept?{1E}{00}
Saturos must have mentioned{03}it atop the lighthouse...{03}I see...{02}{00}
Saturos must have known{03}it, even though he never{03}told you...{02}{00}
They saw that I was a{03}Wind Adept right away...{02}{00}
They kidnapped me for{03}my powers... They needed{03}them on their journey.{02}{00}
Oh, yeah... They would have{03}needed an alignment that{03}complemented their own.{02}{00}
They said they would need{03}a Wind Adept in order to{03}light Jupiter's beacon.{02}{00}
Ah, of course... And I{03}suspect we'll need your{03}power there as well.{02}{00}
So you see, you{03}do need me.{02}{00}
All right... I guess{03}I understand now.{02}{00}
But you want to know what she{03}meant by destiny, too, don't you?{1E}{00}
I wish we could read{03}minds like {11}{07}.{03}Then we'd know...{02}{00}
Oh, so it's just me?{03}Too bad I can't read{03}minds like {11}{07}, huh?{02}{00}
I'm sure she will tell us{03}in her own time.{03}{05}Won't you, {11}{07}?{02}{00}
I think, for now, that we{03}should simply trust {11}{07}.{02}{00}
Now, I am quite famished.{03}Shall we get moving?{02}{00}
You don't look familiar.{03}Have you been to Daila before?{1E}{00}
Strange... I just don't{03}remember ever seeing{03}you around here before.{02}{00}
Well then, welcome to Daila,{03}the northernmost town on{03}the continent of Indra!{02}{00}
We were hit by a gigantic{03}tidal wave, but there were{03}no injuries...{01}It was miraculous!{02}{00}
Didn't it feel like all of Indra{03}moved when that wave hit?{1E}{00}
I knew it!{03}You felt it, too!{05} And that{03}shock afterward!{01}It felt like the whole{03}continent got rammed{03}into something!{02}{00}
Wow... The wave must have{03}knocked you silly if you{03}didn't notice it...{02}{00}
I saw a bright light in the{03}northwestern sky earlier...{03}Somewhere over Gondowan.{01}It was right before the tidal{03}wave... I wonder if there's{03}a connection...{02}{00}
Thank goodness for that{03}mountain range to the{03}north...{01}If that range weren't there,{03}we would have been{03}washed away for sure...{02}{00}
Ohhh...that wave knocked{03}me over, and now I can't{03}get up.{01}I must have been{03}born to suffer!{02}{00}
That ancient tower to the{03}east? It's the Shrine of the{03}Sea God...{01}Listen, if you're not into{03}being cursed horribly, you{03}should stay away from there.{02}{00}
Riki and Tavi sure{03}are out late...{02}{00}
I wonder if those two{03}are still out there...{03}They know it's off-limits.{02}{00}
Our village survived the{03}wave, but all our boats{03}were destroyed...{01}We won't be sailing for{03}a while, but we'll pull{03}through somehow...{02}{00}
Hm? You want a boat?{1E}{00}
What kind of insensitive{03}jerk are you?{01}Everyone knows all our{03}boats were destroyed by{03}the tidal wave!{02}{00}
Of course not!{03}The tidal wave ruined{03}all our boats...{01}Asking us for a boat now{03}would be just plain mean!{02}{00}
That tidal wave left a lot{03}of standing water in our{03}village...{01}The worst part is that{03}it's all salt water.{02}{00}
Yaaay! Puddles in the{03}village! Yaaay!{02}{00}
Bleah! I fell in a puddle{03}and got my clothes dirty!{03}Mom's gonna have a fit!{02}{00}
That wave turned this place{03}into a swamp! Everything{03}smells like brine!{02}{00}
That must have been one{03}serious wave to make the{03}whole continent move...{01}I didn't even know{03}continents did that!{02}{00}
I thought I saw some lights{03}in the northwestern skies...{03}Maybe I just imagined them.{02}{00}
The sea god must have saved{03}us from the wave. It's good we{03}have a shrine honoring him.{02}{00}
My hip's killing me, and all{03}that woman cares about is{03}how muddy my clothes are!{01}She cares more about the{03}laundry than she does me!{02}{00}
I can't believe those{03}children play in the shrine!{01}It's dangerous, and it will{03}only bring them misfortune...{02}{00}
The Shrine of the Sea God{03}stopped the wave, but I'm{03}worried...{01}Riki and Tavi were{03}playing in there, and I'm{03}too scared to tell anyone.{02}{00}
I can't believe those losers{03}were inside the shrine when{03}the wave hit!{01}If Riki and Tavi want{03}to be idiots, I say, let 'em!{02}{00}
That wave was brutal!{03}It smashed my boat{03}to splinters!{02}{00}
With all the boats gone,{03}we sailors are stuck here!{01}What are we supposed{03}to do on dry land? Knit!?{02}{00}
With all this salt water{03}on the ground, what will{03}happen to our crops?{02}{00}
Yay! We never get puddles{03}like this, not even when{03}it rains!{02}{00}
Bleccch!{03}This water's saaalty!{02}{00}
Riki's really in for it{03}when he gets home!{01}He's been out playing{03}with his friend for days!{02}{00}
That no-good kid of mine!{03}Taking his father's fishing{03}pole! I mean, really!{01}If he doesn't come home{03}soon, he's really going to{03}get it!{02}{00}
Riki, Tavi... Where are{03}you? What are you up to?{02}{00}
That Tavi's a bad{03}influence on Riki...{01}Just because he lives{03}next door doesn't mean{03}they have to be friends!{02}{00}
I wonder where our{03}little Tavi has gone.{03}I'm getting worried.{01}He was gone when the{03}wave hit, and he hasn't{03}been home since...{02}{00}
Tavi never misses{03}three o'clock snacksies!{01}Where could he be?{03}His food's getting cold...{02}{00}
I'll bet that, wherever{03}Tavi is, Riki is{03}with him...{01}The neighbors must be{03}pretty worried, too.{02}{00}
If Tavi isn't home{03}soon, we're going to have{03}to go looking for him.{02}{00}
If you're looking for a{03}boat, you might check{03}in Madra...{01}Head south, and then when{03}the road forks, follow{03}the path to the east.{02}{00}
If you head south, you'll{03}find a fork in the road.{01}Take the road west, and{03}you'll hit the Kandorean{03}Temple in no time.{02}{00}
I wonder how the road{03}to Madra is holding up{03}after that flood...{01}The ground was always{03}pretty soft around there...{02}{00}
I wonder if the holy man{03}at the Kandorean Temple is{03}as powerful as they say...{02}{00}
In all my years as mayor,{03}I've never seen a wave{03}like that before...{01}I'm grateful that nobody{03}was seriously injured.{02}{00}
The wave was awful, but{03}the noise that followed{03}was even worse...{01}The shock alone could{03}probably have destroyed{03}the road to Madra.{02}{00}
A lot of folk said they{03}heard a terrible rumbling{03}from the southeast.{01}You ask me, it was the{03}road to Madra crumbling{03}to bits...{02}{00}
Between the pirates and{03}the tidal waves, this{03}town has the worst luck!{01}Now that Briggs has been{03}arrested in Madra, maybe{03}our luck is changing...{02}{00}
At least, nobody seems to{03}have been injured too badly.{01}Maybe I should make{03}another inspection later.{02}{00}
I still don't know what{03}that sound I heard was...{01}With everything that's been{03}going on lately, I'm still a{03}little bit edgy...{02}{00}
We should find a different{03}way to get to Madra. That{03}shoddy road's a mess...{02}{00}
Now that Briggs is locked{03}away, we shouldn't have any{03}pirate trouble this year.{01}Of course, that tidal wave{03}did more damage than those{03}pirates ever managed...{02}{00}
You folks ain't thinkin'{03}'bout goin' south, are ya?{01}The roads to the south{03}are a real mess from the{03}earthquake. Dangerous, too.{02}{00}
I'm glad I'm not going to{03}Madra now... It had been{03}so parched for so long...{01}And now, after the quake,{03}I'm sure it's full of cracks{03}and fissures and gaps...{02}{00}
You guys look new 'round{03}these parts! What brings{03}you to here?{01}There's nothing much to see{03}on this forsaken continent.{03}You must be odd folk indeed!{02}{00}
If those two scamps knew{03}there were travelers in town,{03}they'd have a field day.{02}{00}
I haven't seen Tavi and{03}Riki around lately...{01}I like those little guys,{03}so I'm kind of worried{03}about 'em.{02}{00}
I'm sure those two went to{03}the Shrine of the Sea God.{03}They never listen!{01}I told them they were{03}way too small to climb{03}those cliffs...{02}{00}
What should I cook for our{03}guests tonight? I just can't{03}decide.{02}{00}
We run a very small inn, so{03}we make do with just the{03}two of us working here...{02}{00}
I don't know when I'll be{03}able to return to Madra. I{03}sure miss the food there.{02}{00}
I hear the seafood in{03}Madra is wonderful!{01}I wonder what kinds of{03}fish they catch in Madra...{02}{00}
We can't sail, and we can't{03}fish... Not with our ships in{03}this condition...{01}{09}{04}Oh...{07} I'm not looking{03}forward to becoming{03}a vegetarian...{02}{00}
Look at all these guests!{03}We need more help...but{03}how will we afford it?{02}{00}
After all that shaking, I{03}wouldn't be surprised if{03}the roads were unusable.{02}{00}
I'm so torn... Do I like{03}my fish grilled?{01}Or do I prefer poached?{03}It's hard to say... Why is{03}life so difficult?{02}{00}
Travelers! Well, I'll be!{03}Do you have a lot of time{03}and nowhere to go?{1E}{00}
Then I suggest you visit{03}the Kandorean Temple to{03}see Master Poi.{01}He performs great feats,{03}but I'll warn you, he might{03}not let you in...{02}{00}
Oh, going to Madra, are you?{01}It's a dangerous road,{03}but no one will stop you{03}from taking it, my children.{02}{00}
Travelers with nowhere to{03}go... This is bad. I hope they{03}stay out of the shrine...{01}If they anger the sea god,{03}there's nowhere they could{03}hide, not anywhere in Indra!{02}{00}
Have you come to{03}see Master Poi?{1E}{00}
The master will see no one.{03}Leave now, and do not{03}return.{02}{00}
I'm sorry, but the temple{03}is closed to sightseers.{03}Go home now.{02}{00}
Once the period of meditation{03}has begun, none may enter{03}the temple grounds.{01}Master Poi's teachings{03}require absolute concentration.{02}{00}
I do not understand Master{03}Poi. If I were him, I would{03}allow more people to enter.{01}Instead, I must turn away{03}the very people who would{03}benefit from his teachings.{02}{00}
I was hoping to hear Master{03}Poi speak. Instead, I got{03}guard duty. How boring...{02}{00}
I hope to enter the temple{03}one day... I want to learn{03}from the master himself...{02}{00}
Please don't break{03}my concentration!{01}I am...lighter than air...{03}floating, rising up...{02}{00}
I am not just meditating.{03}I am guarding the entry{03}as well. It is important work.{01}But someday, I will be{03}permitted to enter{03}the temple...{02}{00}
I still can't believe that{03}the older monks can{03}levitate through meditation.{01}If I work hard enough,{03}maybe I'll be able to do{03}it, too. Maybe.{02}{00}
My mind is empty;{03}my body is light...{03}Now...float...float...{02}{00}
Empty the mind{03}to lighten the body...{01}I've been fasting for{03}days... I've got to be{03}light enough by now!{02}{00}
You there!{03}Focus your mind!{02}{00}
Did you see that, Master?{02}{00}
No, no, no!{03}You lack discipline!{02}{00}
Now, you!{02}{00}
How was that, Master?{02}{00}
Improving...slowly!{03}Continue your meditation!{02}{00}
Your turn!{02}{00}
Master, have I done it?{02}{00}
Not bad...{03}You might stand a{03}chance to succeed...{02}{00}
I can do it, Master!{03}Please, just let me try!{02}{00}
Your skills lack polish...{03}It may be dangerous. Do{03}you still wish to enter?{02}{00}
Yes, I do! I do!{02}{00}
If you fail, you may{03}lose more than just{03}your pride...{02}{00}
I do not fear death, Master!{02}{00}
Ho ho! Is that so?{02}{00}
Very well, then!{03}It is time for your{03}trial, my son!{02}{00}
Enter the cave,{03}and ascend!{02}{00}
HE went in before ME?{03}What nonsense!{01}Wait... I guess I ought{03}to be supportive and{03}hope for his success...{02}{00}
Empty mind, empty body.{03}By clearing my thoughts,{03}I can ascend...{02}{00}
There's no way I'm rooting{03}for that loser!{01}Choke! Choke! Fail the test!{03}Then, I'll get my chance!{02}{00}
Arrgh! I was so close!{03}I can't believe I didn't{03}make it!{01}Gah... I'm so consumed{03}with frustration that I{03}can't clear my thoughts...{02}{00}
It seems I may not have{03}been ready after all...{01}I should start my{03}meditations over again...{02}{00}
Is it really possible{03}for anyone to pass{03}this test?{02}{00}
You have passed a very{03}difficult test. You have{03}pleased your teacher!{02}{00}
Wait... You're not one of my{03}students! Who are you!?{02}{00}
How did you...{03}come this far?{02}{00}
Ah, yes... How indeed?{02}{00}
The rope is still{03}on the floor.{02}{00}
You must have come{03}through the cave...{02}{00}
That means...{02}{00}
I must give you...{03}the secret of Lash!{02}{00}
Master Poi...{03}You seem perturbed.{02}{00}
Oh, no...{03}Not at all...{02}{00}
{11}{05}, am I imagining it,{03}or does he seem perturbed?{1E}{00}
I am not perturbed.{03}Merely...surprised.{02}{00}
No one from outside the{03}temple has ever passed{03}the test. It's amazing...{02}{00}
What is this "Lash" you{03}mentioned a moment ago?{02}{00}
Lash is a sacred power,{03}passed down for years to{03}the followers of this temple.{02}{00}
A sacred power? And{03}it's called Lash,{03}you say?{02}{00}
And now, I must pass it{03}on to you. It is our way.{02}{00}
It is a gift given to all those{03}who pass the test, as it{03}has been for ages.{02}{00}
What type of power{03}is this Lash?{02}{00}
Allow me to show you.{02}{00}
Lash looks quite a bit{03}like Psynergy, doesn't it?{1E}{00}
Psynergy, hm?{03}We call it spiritual strength,{03}but it seems the same.{02}{00}
I do not know of your{03}Psynergy, but our power{03}comes from within.{02}{00}
This technique uses{03}the spiritual to affect{03}the physical.{02}{00}
One with a strong spirit{03}can lift and move heavy{03}objects farther.{02}{00}
The distance changes with{03}your level of power?{03}Fascinating!{02}{00}
Those who cannot pass{03}this cave's trials are not{03}worthy of the technique.{02}{00}
{11}{05}, do you think this{03}cave was designed to test{03}one's control of Psynergy?{1E}{00}
Yes, yes!{03}Well done, old man!{02}{00}
Who are you calling an{03}old man!? You're no spring{03}chicken yourself!{02}{00}
You are quite mistaken...{03}You should listen to the{03}old man. He speaks wisely.{02}{00}
Tha{B0}HEY! Who are you{03}calling an old man? You're{03}no schoolboy yourself!{02}{00}
I wondered if it would be{03}right to allow an outsider{03}to use this power...{02}{00}
You're...not going{03}to teach us?{02}{00}
But I like you, so I will{03}let you learn our secret.{02}{00}
Please, follow me.{02}{00}
Take the power of{03}Lash. It is yours now.{02}{00}
This is the power and the{03}secret of our temple!{02}{00}
If you are worthy, you{03}will use it with ease!{02}{00}
When you see a rope,{03}use Lash on it...{02}{00}
Perhaps you will find this{03}useful on your travels.{02}{00}
Take this power with{03}you, and do good.{02}{00}
I hope that someday, my{03}students will be worthy{03}of this honor, too.{02}{00}
If you wish to practice,{03}these caves may hold a{03}place of interest to you...{02}{00}
Ho ho! I feel the strength{03}of your spirit flowing{03}toward me! Splendid!{02}{00}
You were the ones{03}who passed the test?{1E}{00}
Wow! I can't believe it!{03}Are you monks? Where{03}did you study!?{02}{00}
Well, if it wasn't you,{03}who was it?{02}{00}
I hear that someone{03}passed the test...{03}No matter, though...{01}I am here to improve{03}myself, to meditate...{03}Not to show off.{02}{00}
When I awoke, I learned{03}that someone else had passed{03}my test... How disgraceful.{02}{00}
The master seemed so{03}disappointed that someone{03}passed the test...{01}I think it was just that{03}none of his students{03}can do it yet...{02}{00}
I knew it!{03}It should have been{03}me taking that test!{02}{00}
Before I passed out,{03}I saw...something...{01}Some sort of...cute little{03}monster. Was I delirious?{02}{00}
Hey, what's an outsider{03}doing on the temple{03}grounds?{01}Oh, meditation must be{03}over... That's why they{03}let you in...{02}{00}
Looks like none of our{03}brothers passed this time,{03}either.{01}At this rate, maybe we'll{03}be able to surpass them{03}after all.{02}{00}
Someday, I'm going to{03}be a great monk, like{03}Master Poi.{02}{00}
Gah! I kept my eyes shut in{03}meditation so long that the{03}sun hurts when I open them!{02}{00}
I've been meditating all{03}day, but my body just{03}doesn't want to float...{02}{00}
Whenever the master goes{03}to town, the villagers are{03}all in such awe of him...{01}Maybe someday, they'll{03}look at me the same way.{02}{00}
Extinguish your desire,{03}and the fire will cool.{01}Empty your mind,{03}and you will feel no pain!{03}                    -Poi-{02}{00}
{09}{02}Ouch!{02}{00}
This wall looks rather{03}suspicious, wouldn't you{03}say, {11}{05}?{02}{00}
Fantastic work, {11}{05}!{03}Keep a watchful eye for{03}any strange-looking areas!{02}{00}
All right! I'm gonna{03}throw the rope again!{02}{00}
Just don't miss{03}this time!{02}{00}
Aww, no!{03}You missed again!{02}{00}
Sorry, Tavi...{03}I can't do it!{02}{00}
I thought I got lucky{03}when that wave carried{03}me up here...{02}{00}
What are you, crazy? It{03}knocked you stupid{03}for a good ten minutes!{02}{00}
Yeah, yeah!{03}Just find some way to{03}get me down from here!{02}{00}
Fine! Just don't jump{03}down or do anything{03}dumb, OK?{02}{00}
Wah! You scared me!{02}{00}
I thought you were one{03}of the grown-ups from{03}Daila... {05}So, who are you?{02}{00}
Look, I'm kinda busy trying{03}to help my pal Tavi{03}right now, OK?{02}{00}
I can't find anything{03}around here that'll help{03}get him down from there!{02}{00}
Excellent work, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
Hey, the rope!{02}{00}
Awesome, Riki!{03}Way to go!{02}{00}
Who are you?{02}{00}
We're just passing through.{02}{00}
How come you threw{03}me the rope?{02}{00}
We'd heard that you{03}needed some assistance.{02}{00}
Well, whatever.{03}Thanks anyway.{02}{00}
Hey, Tavi!{02}{00}
How'd ya get{03}down from there?{02}{00}
These guys threw{03}me the rope...{02}{00}
Really? These grown-ups?{02}{00}
Well, whatever.{03}Now we can go nab{03}that critter we saw!{02}{00}
What? What is it?{02}{00}
That little guy's so fast,{03}I can't catch him!{02}{00}
Do you think we could{03}catch him together?{02}{00}
Well, yeah, except that{03}every time I'm about to{03}grab him, he flies off!{02}{00}
So I guess it wouldn't{03}matter if we worked{03}together or not.{02}{00}
Yeah, I guess not.{02}{00}
Well, that's too bad.{02}{00}
Hey, I'm really hungry!{03}I haven't eaten since{03}before I got stuck!{02}{00}
Yeah, same here...{03}My stomach's growling{03}up a storm!{02}{00}
Let's go home, Riki.{02}{00}
Sounds good, Tavi.{02}{00}
They're gone...{02}{00}
Well, it was good of{03}you to help them.{02}{00}
We should be going, too.{02}{00}
This statue looks a lot like{03}the one in Daila's Sanctum.{02}{00}
I took all the money that was{03}in here to pay for a boat.{01}Don't think badly of me.{03}-Alex.{02}{00}
After that wave hit, I was{03}worried about Daila, but{03}we're pulling through...{02}{00}
Sure are a lot of travelers{03}coming through here today.{01}That last one, though...{03}He was awful cute.{02}{00}
Those puddles of sea-{03}water the wave left have{03}almost all evaporated now.{02}{00}
Ah, the sea is calm again,{03}and we can all get back{03}to our normal lives.{02}{00}
I bet you thought it was{03}the wave that knocked me{03}over and hurt my hip, huh?{1E}{00}
It'd take more than a little{03}water to knock this old-{03}timer down!{01}No, it was the earthquake{03}afterward that made me{03}fall on my tush...{02}{00}
Nobody believes me when{03}I tell them the continent{03}moved...{01}Why do you think I fell?{03}The ground shifts, you fall{03}on your fanny! It's a fact!{02}{00}
I've always heard that the{03}Shrine of the Sea God holds{03}an amazing treasure...{02}{00}
The dread pirate Briggs{03}was captured in Madra...{01}If that guy were free, you{03}could bet he'd be coming{03}after our village...{02}{00}
Those two losers are{03}back home now, eating{03}their snacks...{02}{00}
I thought I saw something{03}when those puddles dried.{03}Maybe it was just my eyes.{02}{00}
So...I hear they caught{03}the pirate Briggs down{03}in Madra...{01}The seas should be safe{03}now. Makes me wish I still{03}had a boat...{02}{00}
It was creepy{B0}right before{03}the wave hit, the water{03}got all quiet and calm.{01}I don't know how to{03}explain it, but it was{03}really eerie.{02}{00}
The puddles are gone,{03}and now I'm bored.{02}{00}
I got hurt when I was{03}playing in the puddles,{03}so now I'm not.{02}{00}
Thank our lucky stars{03}our little town survived{03}that ordeal.{02}{00}
Is that guy still meeting{03}with the mayor?{02}{00}
Those puddles stank!{03}I thought I'd get sick from{03}the smell of stagnant brine!{02}{00}
I'm glad everything is back{03}to normal here in Daila...{02}{00}
Nobody believes a wave{03}could be big enough to{03}move a continent...{01}I'm starting to think it's a{03}sign of things to come,{03}personally...{02}{00}
I'd sure like to see what{03}that treasure is...{02}{00}
I wonder what happened{03}to Briggs when they{03}caught him...{02}{00}
Tavi and Riki must{03}have been starving. They{03}were gone for days...{02}{00}
It's probably nothing but{03}junk and garbage, but it's{03}not my problem...{02}{00}
The seas are peaceful and{03}free of pirates at last, and{03}I don't even have a boat.{01}Life's funny like that.{02}{00}
Before the wave hit, the{03}tide went way out...{01}It was like the sea had{03}been drained away...{02}{00}
I hope some of the little{03}puddles stay, at least.{02}{00}
I caught my foot on{03}something that was in one{03}of those dried-up puddles.{02}{00}
Let me tell you, kids{03}are a lot of work...{01}If they're not out getting{03}in trouble, they're inside,{03}and they're eating!{02}{00}
Who stays outside until{03}he's absolutely famished?{01}And would it have hurt{03}to let us know where{03}he was going!?{02}{00}
Mmm... Mmnph...{03}Dad was SO mad that{03}we were late...{01}He said, "No dinner for{03}you!" And I was like,{03}"Whatever!"{02}{00}
Darn that Riki!{03}Ah... I'm glad he's{03}home, though...{01}He's so cute when{03}he's stuffing his face.{02}{00}
Hee hee. My Riki is{03}mommy's little monster!{03}Just look how he eats!{02}{00}
I still want to{03}catch that monster.{01}We are SO going back{03}there tomorrow.{02}{00}
Our little one is{03}finally home.{01}I don't know where he{03}got to for all that time.{02}{00}
Tavi wolfed down{03}his snack and just{03}asked for more!{01}He must think we're here{03}to feed him, I swear!{02}{00}
Mmmph... Mmmm.{03}Don't tell anyone we were in{03}the Shrine of the Sea God.{02}{00}
I guess Riki next door{03}made it home, too...{01}Those two are just{03}inseparable.{02}{00}
Once Tavi finishes{03}eating, I'm putting him{03}right outside again!{02}{00}
I'm sure glad I made it{03}down from that cliff...{01}I could have starved{03}up there!{02}{00}
Are you going to Madra?{1E}{00}
You'll have to cross the{03}Dehkan Plateau...{01}It's a dangerous place.{03}You'll want to be very,{03}very careful out there.{02}{00}
Walking into trouble just{03}for a boat ain't exactly{03}smart...{01}But sometimes, you have to{03}face danger to move forward.{02}{00}
I think Madra is east of{03}the crossroads... I think...{02}{00}
Daila got hit pretty hard.{03}I wonder how Madra is{03}doing...{02}{00}
Someone should see{03}how the road to Madra{03}held up in the quake...{02}{00}
{11}{05}...{02}{00}
Well, well... Our happy{03}little family is back{03}together again.{02}{00}
Alex...{03}Where did you go?{02}{00}
To look for a ship,{03}of course.{02}{00}
That's what Kraden said...{02}{00}
And did you find one?{02}{00}
Unfortunately, there are{03}none to be had.{02}{00}
I spoke to the mayor, and{03}he suggested that we try{03}the large town south of us.{02}{00}
Is that where you're going?{02}{00}
Yes. Madra may have boats{03}available. That would be{03}the most logical move.{02}{00}
So what do yout think?{03}Should we go to Madra{03}with Alex?{1E}{00}
Ah... You...want to{03}travel with me?{02}{00}
What, you don't like{03}that idea?{02}{00}
Ah. {11}{05} doesn't{03}think it's a good idea.{02}{00}
You seem awfully{03}pleased about that...{02}{00}
No, that's not it. I'm{03}just...preoccupied.{02}{00}
Self-absorbed is more{03}like it!{02}{00}
I simply prefer{03}to work alone.{02}{00}
If that's the case,{03}we'll let you be...{02}{00}
Perhaps you will see{03}me in Madra...{02}{00}
Gah! The nerve of that guy!{02}{00}
Yeah, I know... Now, I just{03}want to find a boat before{03}he does!{02}{00}
Let's be on our way.{02}{00}
Don't tell me you're all{03}looking for a boat, too!{1E}{00}
Look, there aren't any{03}boats here, not for you{03}or anyone!{01}Try Madra, down south!{02}{00}
If I had one, I'd let you{03}use it, but I don't.{02}{00}
It's too dangerous to{03}go to Madra now.{01}I wonder if that man who{03}wanted the boat will survive{03}on the Dehkan Plateau.{02}{00}
Who was that guy?{03}I wonder why he needed{03}a boat so badly.{02}{00}
Why did the pirate{03}Briggs plague us{03}for so long?{01}If I were going to Madra,{03}I'd go look him in the{03}eyes and ask him!{02}{00}
He said he'd pay me{03}a fortune for a boat.{01}I'm not sure he'd pay{03}me even if I'd had one,{03}though...{02}{00}
The road to Madra goes{03}through the Dehkan Plateau.{01}It's nearly impossible to{03}cross over that soft,{03}crumbly soil right now.{02}{00}
Maybe that guy washed{03}up on shore when the{03}wave hit...{02}{00}
Briggs probably has{03}lots of men under him...{01}If I lived in Madra, I'd be{03}more worried about them{03}coming to rescue him.{02}{00}
Way back when, Daila used{03}to be a hideout for a band{03}of pirates...{01}They were all captured,{03}but no one ever found{03}their stolen treasure.{02}{00}
This town may be dirt-{03}poor, but we still get a{03}good variety of travelers.{01}They're searching for{03}treasure, I'll bet. I hear{03}even Briggs was after it!{02}{00}
We don't have a lot of{03}people in Daila, but it's{03}a very spacious town...{01}The layout confuses{03}me sometimes!{02}{00}
Maybe they hid treasure{03}here because this town{03}is so mazelike...{02}{00}
Tavi and Riki{03}are back home, safe{03}and sound...{01}They stopped by{03}to say hello on their{03}way... What nice kids.{02}{00}
I hope their parents{03}didn't punish them too{03}severely...{01}They must have{03}worried their parents{03}half to death!{02}{00}
Our fishermen still can't{03}head out to sea...{01}When will they start{03}fixing all those boats!?{02}{00}
Oh, I was just practicing.{03}It's part of our dinner{03}show for guests...{01}You know, because we{03}don't actually have any{03}good food for dinner...{02}{00}
Er... Aheh heh... You...{03}weren't watching, were you?{02}{00}
I was just practicing{03}for the show we're putting{03}on tonight.{02}{00}
When do we get to{03}sample some of Daila's{03}famous seafood?{02}{00}
I'm sick of eating nothing{03}but vegetables... And the{03}service stinks!{01}At least there's a show.{03}I wonder what we'll see{03}tonight...{02}{00}
Until we get our seafood{03}back, we have to put on{03}these shows for guests...{01}My feet hurt... I wonder{03}if they'll let me skip{03}tonight's performance...{02}{00}
Shoot... What was my first{03}line? "Welcome to the Palace{03}of the Dragon King"?{02}{00}
Putting on shows instead of{03}serving good food is fine,{03}I guess...{01}But won't stories about sea{03}dragons make people{03}think about seafood?{02}{00}
I just hope they don't make{03}us watch another one of{03}those awful shows!{01}I'd rather eat a pile of{03}steamed cabbage than{03}watch them again!{02}{00}
Maybe I'll just get up{03}on stage and do a little{03}dance of my own tonight.{02}{00}
There is nothing left for{03}you in Daila...{01}Please be careful on{03}your journey to Madra.{02}{00}
Daila's probably pretty{03}boring for travelers.{02}{00}
Look...{03}It's Menardi's ship!{02}{00}
It doesn't look like{03}they sailed here, though...{02}{00}
Of course not...{03}They were killed at the{03}lighthouse, weren't they?{02}{00}
Do you think it could{03}have drifted here?{1E}{00}
Yes, {11}{05},{03}That would be logical...{02}{00}
How else could it have{03}come to be here, {11}{05}?{02}{00}
If we had that thingie{03}Saturos had, we could{03}just take their boat.{02}{00}
For all we know, the orb{03}is at the bottom of the{03}sea...with them...{02}{00}
Well, there's no point{03}in hanging around here{03}all day.{02}{00}
Let's go see about{03}finding ourselves a{03}ship we can use.{02}{00}
We've been found!{02}{00}
You wanna fight, punk?{02}{00}
No one said anything{03}about fighting yet!{02}{00}
We haven't done{03}anything to you!{02}{00}
And if you think we{03}did, then prove it!{02}{00}
I'm, uh, from Kibombo...{03}It's, er...nice to meet you.{02}{00}
Hey, we're just here to{03}finish what you guys{03}started, OK?{01}You guys are the ones who{03}rammed into our continent,{03}and don't you forget it!{02}{00}
Hey, we're just out here, uh...{03}camping... Yup. If you want{03}good camping, go to Indra.{01}We're just here to, you know,{03}see the sights and stuff.{02}{00}
Our friends from Kibombo{03}are coming soon.{01}When they get here,{03}we'll all come say hello.{02}{00}
Oh, tense... We're busted!{03}They're on to us, I know it!{01}We never should have{03}launched that raid on{03}Madra without the others!{02}{00}
My family lost its entire{03}store of food{B0}months'{03}worth, gone in a flash!{01}Well, we'll show those{03}foreigners what happens{03}when they mess with us!{02}{00}
And once our Kibombo warriors{03}swarm over your town, we'll{03}all be real good friends...{02}{00}
It was a good raid, but{03}after all that work, we{03}didn't find a thing...{01}I wonder what happened{03}to those people who fled{03}from the jail we broke into.{02}{00}
The door is held closed{03}by a powerful force.{02}{00}
Well, there's no point{03}in hanging around here{03}all day.{01}Let's go see about{03}finding ourselves a{03}ship we can use.{02}{00}
You there!{03}Hold your ground!{02}{00}
What seems to be{03}the trouble?{02}{00}
Just wait there...{02}{00}
They don't look like{03}they're Champa...{02}{00}
I agree...{02}{00}
Sorry for the delay.{03}You may pass.{02}{00}
What were you{03}checking us for?{02}{00}
Our town was sacked{03}by pirates...{02}{00}
They'd come to free{03}their leader, Briggs.{02}{00}
They came from the east,{03}a small party, and we{03}repelled them with ease...{02}{00}
But then, foreigners struck{03}from the west, exploiting a{03}weak point near our prison.{02}{00}
That's over now, though...{03}Feel free to relax and{03}enjoy your time here safely.{02}{00}
There's no way those{03}pirates are coming back...{01}Not after Indra slammed{03}into Osenia. I hear you can{03}even walk there if you want.{02}{00}
All of Indra shifted and{03}collided with Osenia...{03}Everyone's talking about it.{01}As if dealing with{03}invading pirate soldiers{03}wasn't enough!{02}{00}
It's so weird that we can{03}just walk to Osenia now.{03}Crazy, crazy world...{02}{00}
These are rough times...{03}We don't have nearly{03}enough people to help us.{02}{00}
You comin' through here?{1E}{00}
Yeah, well...{05} We're workin'{03}in the hole right now, so...{01}Until we're done here,{03}you're gonna have to enter{03}Madra through the gates.{02}{00}
That's good, 'cause we can't{03}let anyone through right now.{01}If you're goin' to Madra, you're{03}gonna have to go through{03}the front gates.{02}{00}
The Champa dug this hole{03}when they raided our town,{03}but there's more to it...{01}The hole they dug uncovered{03}a cave that runs all the way{03}under our town!{02}{00}
I can't believe the Champa{03}just stumbled onto this{03}cave accidentally...{01}That's like winning the{03}lottery or something!{02}{00}
Who dug this cave?{05}{03}And why?{02}{00}
The town elder took off{03}to deal with Briggs...{03}I wonder where he is now.{02}{00}
You picked the wrong{03}time to come to Madra...{01}We've had disasters, pirate{03}attacks, all sorts of{03}nonsense...{02}{00}
That big wave moved the{03}whole continent of Indra{03}to the south.{01}Now, we're sandwiched{03}between the two continents{03}of Gondowan and Osenia.{02}{00}
Let me guess... You want{03}a boat, right?{01}Look, like I told that last{03}guy, the tidal wave went{03}and ruined all our boats!{02}{00}
Maybe we'll learn Briggs's{03}whereabouts from that{03}captured Champa.{02}{00}
If I could walk to Osenia,{03}I'd like to see Air's Rock,{03}out near Garoh.{02}{00}
Did you come here over{03}the Dehkan Plateau?{01}Yeah? You must have{03}seen that boat grounded{03}near the cave, right?{1E}{00}
I hear it was a Champa{03}boat! And on it, they found{03}an unconscious Champa!{01}So they nabbed him, of{03}course, and they tossed{03}him in our jail!{02}{00}
You didn't? Weird...{01}I wonder if it{03}drifted away...{02}{00}
It's like all three{03}continents got together to{03}form a supercontinent!{02}{00}
The Champa were swarming{03}over the village...{01}But I screamed like the{03}dickens and scared 'em{03}off! It's true! Heh!{02}{00}
Those Champa curs dug a{03}hole here to sneak into{03}Madra...{01}And to think, it was just a{03}decoy so they could break into{03}the prison... What a crazy plan!{02}{00}
I doubt the Champa could{03}have come up with that{03}plan on their own...{01}I'm not even sure that{03}strange boat we found up{03}north is even theirs...{02}{00}
I got someone to show{03}me around inside... It's{03}just a really big hole.{01}Nobody could dig that much{03}in such a short time without{03}us noticing, you'd think...{02}{00}
I don't care what the elder{03}says... That prisoner is{03}filthy Champa scum!{01}Until someone proves{03}otherwise, I say, let{03}him rot!{02}{00}
We took that unconscious{03}guy from the boat and{03}tossed him in jail.{01}He keeps saying that{03}he's not Champa, though.{02}{00}
My friend was on guard{03}duty when Briggs's{03}men attacked...{01}Who would let a menace{03}like Briggs go free?{02}{00}
My partner was guarding{03}the prison...{01}When the Champa attacked,{03}he was so scared, he ran{03}off. Disgraceful!{02}{00}
Everyone thinks Briggs{03}fled to the east after the{03}breakout...{01}I think that must be{03}where the elder went{03}with the others.{02}{00}
The town elder is getting{03}pretty elderly. I hope he's{03}OK, traveling out there...{02}{00}
If a big wave can move{03}the whole continent of{03}Indra...{01}Does that mean that all{03}of Indra is just floating{03}on the water?{02}{00}
It's a bit of a problem that{03}the tidal wave destroyed{03}our boats...{01}But the tidal wave sort of{03}solved the problem, too...{01}Now, all three continents{03}are wedged together, and{03}we don't really need boats.{02}{00}
That Champa in the cell{03}looks a bit pale for a{03}pirate...{01}I thought pirates were{03}supposed to be all tan{03}and leathery...{02}{00}
I've always wanted to see{03}Air's Rock...but Garoh is{03}such a long way away...{02}{00}
Who was it who told me the{03}Champa boat was damaged?{01}Doesn't matter... But I bet{03}Briggs went to Osenia{03}to find himself a new boat.{02}{00}
Now, Madra is pinned{03}between two continents!{01}People from Gondowan{03}can walk here to visit!{03}What fun!{02}{00}
When I saw those Champa,{03}I was so surprised that{03}I let out a yelp...{01}It must have startled{03}them, because they all{03}ran away!{02}{00}
The Champa must have{03}known exactly where{03}Briggs was...{01}But how did they know{03}the layout of our town?{02}{00}
It's not like the Champa{03}to plan out elaborate{03}strategies...{01}I think the two raids were{03}entirely coincidental.{02}{00}
I'm not sure the Champa{03}actually dug this hole...{02}{00}
I'll never forgive those{03}dogs for what they've{03}done to our village.{02}{00}
I looked into that man's{03}eyes. He looked so serene,{03}so calm...{01}No one with such pretty{03}eyes could be a liar.{02}{00}
I wonder how many{03}of the raiders were{03}actually Champa.{02}{00}
I miss my partner...{03}It's a shame he turned{03}tail and ran like that...{01}But who knows? Maybe I{03}would have done the same{03}thing in his place...{02}{00}
In all this chaos, everyone{03}here has clean forgotten{03}about Alhafra...{01}Sure, it's all the way in{03}Osenia, but they're bound{03}to have a boat or two.{02}{00}
Madra and Alhafra, off in{03}Osenia, have a long{03}history together...{01}Alhafra's a thriving{03}seaport, up on the{03}northern coast.{02}{00}
Wait a second... I'll bet{03}Briggs is heading to{03}Alhafra!{01}Of course! That'd be the{03}place to go if you were{03}looking for a boat!{02}{00}
Alhafra has long been{03}a trade partner with Madra.{01}I should go there one day...{03}It's such an easy trip{03}from North Osenia...{02}{00}
The lands to the south{03}of Gondowan are full of{03}barbarians, I'm told.{02}{00}
Indra is in direct contact{03}with southern Gondowan...{03}Will we be safe?{1E}{00}
You're just trying to make{03}me feel better, but you{03}don't have a clue, do you?{02}{00}
Listen, we don't need you{03}running around getting{03}folks worked up! Buzz off!{02}{00}
The Kibombo are warlike,{03}but they live far off in the{03}center of Gondowan...{01}I can't imagine they'd{03}come all the way out{03}here...{02}{00}
They say there are people{03}who use a frightening kind of{03}magic in Gondowan...{01}I don't know if it's{03}true, but it's absolutely{03}terrifying!{02}{00}
A wave big enough to{03}move a continent is{03}a terrible portent...{01}Could the legendary{03}beast of the deep{03}have awakened?{02}{00}
Everything happened so{03}suddenly... The earth moved,{03}and everything fell down...{01}It's going to take me{03}forever to clean up...{02}{00}
If the mythical sea{03}creature has awakened,{03}we're all in trouble...{01}The legends say that only{03}one armed with an enchanted{03}trident can kill it.{02}{00}
Everything's on the floor,{03}and all my dishes are{03}broken. What a chore!{02}{00}
They say that boat belongs{03}to the Champa...{01}But I keep telling them,{03}that boat looks like no{03}Champa ship I've seen.{02}{00}
The boat that ran aground{03}in the cove out east looks{03}like a normal ship, almost...{01}But I'm not sure a boat{03}like that can even sail.{02}{00}
That boat's far sturdier{03}and far more sleek than{03}any Champa could build.{02}{00}
It didn't even have{03}any oars! How does{03}it move? I don't get it.{02}{00}
Milady and I have been{03}told to guard that{03}jewel on the mantel.{02}{00}
Don't touch that gem!{03}The elder gave us strict{03}orders to protect it!{02}{00}
My father was opposed to{03}arresting the man we{03}found on the boat...{01}But the townspeople were in{03}an uproar about the Champa,{03}and they locked him up...{02}{00}
When the elder gets back,{03}I'm sure he will prove{03}that young man innocent.{02}{00}
Dad and Grandpa have{03}gone to Osenia to look{03}for Briggs...{02}{00}
Whenever Dad goes on{03}trips, he brings back{03}presents!{01}I wonder what he'll bring{03}back this time...{02}{00}
I wish I knew why{03}the elder wanted us{03}to protect this thing...{02}{00}
Until my father returns,{03}I'll protect this gem{03}with my life.{02}{00}
He intends to find Briggs{03}and prove that young man's{03}innocence.{02}{00}
If Dad has to fight,{03}I wonder if he'll go...{02}{00}
I hope he brings me a{03}nice doll. I want a{03}wooden one!{02}{00}
Admit it! You're one of{03}the Champa, aren't you,{03}{11}{08}?{02}{00}
Speak! Or let your{03}silence condemn you!{02}{00}
I told you already...{03}I'm not a Champa.{02}{00}
Then where did you{03}come from?{02}{00}
The heart of the Eastern{03}Sea... If I told you where,{03}you'd never believe me.{02}{00}
Look at me when I'm{03}talking to you! Are you{03}trying to mock me!?{02}{00}
I implore you, do not{03}anger me.{02}{00}
Oh, do you? So what's{03}going to happen if I{03}make you angry?{02}{00}
Hey, Shin...{03}Maybe you should go{03}easy on him...{02}{00}
Hey, it wasn't your{03}girlfriend who got hurt!{02}{00}
I'm sorry she was{03}injured, but I cannot{B0}{02}{00}
I don't want your sympathy,{03}freak! I want you to get{03}angry for me!{02}{00}
Stop, please...{03}Even my patience{03}has its limits.{02}{00}
Hey, don't you want{03}to see what he'll do?{02}{00}
I think we should{03}just stop...{02}{00}
If my words will not{03}cool your temper, then...{02}{00}
Oh! That was Psynergy!{02}{00}
Waaaaaaaaaahh!{02}{00}
Did you do that?{02}{00}
What did your friend{03}expect?{02}{00}
You monster!{02}{00}
I...{03}I am no monster.{02}{00}
Help!!!{02}{00}
This man... He must{03}be an Adept!{1E}{00}
Of course! That was{03}clearly Psynergy he{03}just used...{02}{00}
You're right... We only{03}know what we just saw.{02}{00}
Perhaps we should{03}try to learn a little{03}more about him.{02}{00}
Ah... When will that kindly{03}elder return and end my{03}imprisonment?{01}I have no time to wait,{03}but I don't want to have{03}to hurt anyone...{02}{00}
Why did I use my Psynergy{03}in anger? I must maintain{03}control...{01}My actions should{03}never cause regret{B0}{02}{00}
I...sense someone...{03}using Psynergy...{02}{00}
That person...{03}Could he be{B0}no, he is{03}not of my people...{02}{00}
When will I be freed?{02}{00}
Even if we tried to{03}tell someone what{03}we saw...{01}Who would believe us!?{03}I think I'll just guard him{03}from out here, where it's safe.{02}{00}
Was I just dreaming{03}when that shaft of ice{03}appeared?{1E}{00}
Yeah! That's what it was...{03}It was all just a dream...{02}{00}
What!?{05} Oh! Oh... You're just...{03}You're joking with me,{03}right? Yeah...joking...{02}{00}
My sore bottom tells{03}me it was all real...{01}But I'm not about to{03}say that out loud...{02}{00}
It was all just a dream...{03}If I keep on saying it,{03}maybe I'll believe it...{02}{00}
After the Champa opened{03}the jail cells, they came{03}over here...{01}All of us merchants{03}grabbed our own swords{03}and started fighting...{02}{00}
The item vendor got{03}wounded in the attack...{03}She's still recovering.{01}I don't think her boyfriend{03}will ever forgive that man{03}in the jail cell...{02}{00}
Ow. Ow. Ow...{03}I think I got a bone{03}bruise. I hate those...{02}{00}
Those lousy Champa...{01}Next time I see them,{03}they'll be the ones with{03}the bruises!{02}{00}
My sister was hurt{03}when the Champa{03}attacked...{01}She's recovering, but I{03}sure hope Shin gets the{03}guy who did it.{02}{00}
Ohh... {09}{04}Ohhh...{02}{00}
Briggs and his men{03}are horrid. Imagine,{03}hitting a woman...{01}When I think about it,{03}I just get so angry!{02}{00}
Eyes... Shining in the{03}darkness... No! Go away!!!{02}{00}
Surely this town is{03}enduring some sort{03}of test...{01}We must not fail...{02}{00}
We must pass this{03}test. Now is the time{03}to be strong!{01}Come, join hands, and{03}let us give thanks.{02}{00}
A wave that moves the{03}very earth... This is no{03}act of man...{01}But certain forces do{03}move in mysterious ways...{02}{00}
How could one explain{03}a continent moving?{01}Surely, it is the work{03}of a greater power...{02}{00}
If this is a test,{03}please give us a sign.{01}We are your flock...{03}Do with us as you will...{02}{00}
The raid was just another{03}part of the test. It must{03}have been.{02}{00}
Has {11}{08} escaped!?{02}{00}
Oh, I'm so relieved...{03}So {11}{08} hasn't escaped?{02}{00}
If he had escaped, the{03}elder would no longer{03}be able to protect him.{02}{00}
But...from the look of{03}things, it seems there{03}was a scuffle...{02}{00}
The cell is in disarray...{02}{00}
What happened in{03}there, I wonder?{02}{00}
It seems {11}{08} is a man{03}of many mysteries.{02}{00}
Not the least of which{03}being that boat he{03}arrived in...{02}{00}
Oh, you there...{02}{00}
You look like travelers.{02}{00}
Milady, now is not the{03}time to be speaking{03}with strangers!{02}{00}
It's all right... This one{03}has such kind eyes.{02}{00}
When did you arrive?{03}And where are you going?{02}{00}
My lady, please...{02}{00}
Are you...going to Osenia?{1E}{00}
I knew it!{02}{00}
No need to be{03}shy, my friends.{02}{00}
One requires permission{03}to cross the bridge to{03}Osenia, correct?{02}{00}
Then I hereby grant{03}my permission to these{03}four travelers!{02}{00}
Relay that message{03}at once!{02}{00}
You may all continue{03}your journey and cross{03}into Osenia.{02}{00}
Father and the others set{03}out for Osenia to chase{03}Briggs... I hope he is well...{02}{00}
Earthquakes, pirate{03}attacks... What a week!{02}{00}
Our inn is quite safe...{03}The Champa themselves{03}couldn't fight their way in!{02}{00}
I hope those Champa{03}don't come back for{03}a rematch...{02}{00}
I slept right through{03}the pirate raid!{01}It's too bad, too. I would{03}have given those pirates{03}the thumping of a lifetime!{02}{00}
I'm glad my partner and{03}I weren't injured when{03}the Champa attacked.{02}{00}
The new land bridges{03}between the continents{03}should bring more business.{02}{00}
Actually, I think it was{03}just that the Champa knew{03}we didn't have anything{01}worth stealing. I wonder{03}how they knew...{02}{00}
No one was safe from{03}the Champa...not even{03}innocent women!{01}I should learn to{03}defend myself!{02}{00}
I was hiding under my{03}bed the whole time...{01}But I'm not about to{03}tell him that!{02}{00}
We were fine because{03}our karma is good.{01}Only people with bad{03}karma got hurt, I'll bet...{02}{00}
If you wanna cross here,{03}you'll need permission{03}from the town elder!{02}{00}
Without permission, ain't{03}no one's gonna cross this{03}bridge, no matter what!{02}{00}
You goin' to Osenia?{1E}{00}
You'll have to head back to{03}town and get a permit!{01}Just go to the elder's house{03}and ask real nice-like.{02}{00}
Then get lost, pal.{03}These parts can be{03}dangerous...{02}{00}
If you have permission,{03}you can cross anytime.{01}But try to cross illegally,{03}and we'll throw you in the{03}hoosegow with Mr. Bluehair!{02}{00}
I wish I could tell 'em{03}it's nothing personal...{03}It's for their own good.{01}Who knows what's{03}waiting to gobble 'em{03}up in Osenia!{02}{00}
I'm startin' to wonder when{03}the elder and the others'll{03}come back from Osenia.{02}{00}
Yeah, we heard about{03}you already.{01}If you're going to{03}Osenia, you'd better{03}get moving.{02}{00}
Alhafra is up along the{03}northeast of Osenia...{03}You'll see it eventually.{02}{00}
Head to Southeast{03}Osenia, and you'll{03}hit Mikasalla.{01}It's a small village, though.{03}Probably not much to{03}interest you there.{02}{00}
If you try heading straight{03}through Osenia to Alhafra,{03}you'll hit Yampi Desert.{01}You'd be better off avoiding{03}the desert and just following{03}the coast to Alhafra instead.{02}{00}
Unless I had a boat, I{03}wouldn't go to Osenia,{03}with permission or without.{02}{00}
These guys must be looking{03}for trouble. Me, I'd rather{03}stay home and relax.{01}It's so pleasant and{03}comfortable.{05} And safe.{02}{00}
This is a Champa boat...{03}You can see their mark{03}on the flag there.{01}They must have been{03}run aground here by the{03}tidal wave.{02}{00}
Wait, if this is the Champa{03}ship, then that must mean{03}{11}{08} isn't a Champa!{01}So...why does the elder{03}still need Briggs to{03}clear his name?{02}{00}
Look at all the damage...{03}That wave must have{03}been gigantic...{01}I wonder how many{03}Champa died in the{03}wreck...{02}{00}
I guess even if they{03}did free Briggs...{01}They wouldn't have{03}been able to go back{03}out to sea...{02}{00}
Briggs must be trying{03}to get a new ship in{03}Alhafra.{01}I hope the elder finds{03}him first!{02}{00}
They still had enough{03}men to dig that hole{03}and attack Madra.{01}And enough to form{03}two attack parties, too...{02}{00}
Look upon me with eyes{03}of truth... Then the door{03}will open...{02}{00}
The door won't budge.{03}...Must be locked.{02}{00}
It's been a long time{03}since we had any{03}visitors in Mikasalla.{02}{00}
Are you looking{03}for someone?{1E}{00}
Well, if you're looking for{03}someone...{01}I'd say the best place{03}to start would be...{03}somewhere else.{02}{00}
Didn't think so...{03}We don't get a lot of{03}strangers coming here.{02}{00}
I went out to investigate{03}after the earthquake...{01}It looks like a whole{03}different land collided{03}into our own...{02}{00}
If you're going deeper{03}into Osenia, you'd better{03}be ready for trouble.{02}{00}
In the heart of Osenia{03}lies a sacred place,{03}Air's Rock...{02}{00}
If you want to go into{03}the heart of Osenia,{03}there are two ways...{01}You can approach from the{03}south, or you can come{03}down from the north...{02}{00}
If you look across the{03}ocean to the south,{03}you can see Tundaria.{02}{00}
A town called Garoh{03}lies to the east of us...{01}But...its residents aren't{03}quite...human...{02}{00}
Why would anyone travel{03}all this way just to come{03}to our backwater town?{02}{00}
I like this time of year{03}best of all...{01}It's so much nicer and{03}more pleasant than the{03}harsh winter...{02}{00}
Osenia was big already,{03}but now that we're{03}connected to Indra...{01}It's just huge!{02}{00}
No way I'd leave town...{01}If I got lost on the roads{03}out there, I'd be a monster{03}snack in no time.{02}{00}
Air's Rock has stood there since{03}this world was first formed...{01}Nobody knows exactly{03}what that means, though...{02}{00}
It's weird that you can't{03}go all the way around{03}Osenia from the south...{01}I mean, it's a piece of{03}cake if you go around{03}from the north...{02}{00}
It's bitter cold in{03}Tundaria... It snows{03}there all year long.{02}{00}
The people in Garoh{03}are pretty furry.{01}They look weird{B0}and{03}kinda cuddly{B0}but{03}they're nice enough.{02}{00}
I heard someone say{03}there's another continent{03}west of Gondowan.{01}...At least, that's what{03}my dad used to tell me,{03}rest his soul...{02}{00}
My father-in-law was a{03}great explorer, long ago,{03}as was my husband.{02}{00}
Hey, mister! Are you{03}an explorer?{1E}{00}
Awesome! Don't tell{03}anyone, but I want to be{03}an explorer too someday!{02}{00}
My grandpa used to{03}travel all over the{03}whole world!{02}{00}
It must be nice to get{03}out and see the world...{01}But staying in one place{03}is nice, too.{01}Maybe that's why my{03}dad founded this village.{02}{00}
That boy sure admires{03}his grandpa, but I get{03}really worried about him.{01}I'm afraid he'd get hurt{03}if he became an explorer{03}like his grandfather.{02}{00}
I love exploring out{03}behind the house...{03}It's my secret place!{02}{00}
Buk buk buk...{02}{00}
Bah! {09}{04}Baaaaaaa!{02}{00}
The ground here is so{03}soft! I just want to{03}scratch and dig, buhKAWK!{02}{00}
Oh, yeah! Mmm!{03}I just loves to eat{03}me some grass! Yum!{02}{00}
Those who have climbed{03}Air's Rock claim that they{03}can see the unseeable...{02}{00}
My husband has tried{03}to climb Air's Rock{03}many times...{01}I wish I knew what he{03}saw in that big hunk{03}of rock.{02}{00}
What does the unseeable{03}even look like?{02}{00}
I can't let him try to{03}climb it again. What{03}if he were injured?{02}{00}
We only have a small{03}shop here. I used to{03}specialize in items...{01}But now, I sell armor{03}and weapons, too.{02}{00}
I don't know much about{03}weapons and stuff...{01}I hope they don't ask me{03}any questions. Maybe{03}they only want items...{02}{00}
There aren't any towns{03}between here and Garoh.{01}You should rest here and{03}maybe reequip yourselves{03}before heading out.{02}{00}
You've come a long way,{03}friends. Stay a while, and{03}rest your feet.{02}{00}
There's no reason to go{03}to Garoh unless you were{03}heading to Air's Rock...{02}{00}
Why are travelers always{03}in such a hurry?{01}Like my mum used to{03}say, "Fools rush in..."{02}{00}
Have you been{03}to Garoh?{1E}{00}
They're all werewolves{03}there... They hide away{03}from those who fear them.{01}But their cursed forms{03}come with great powers...{02}{00}
Do not fear their outward{03}appearance...{01}Many revile them, but{03}they are gentle, and they{03}have kind hearts.{02}{00}
I wonder if there are{03}werewolves beyond{03}those in Garoh...{01}I also wonder if they{03}might not be as gentle{03}as Garoh's folk.{02}{00}
Forgive my manners...{02}{00}
No, please...{03}Do not fear me.{02}{00}
I am the warrior Galahad.{01}I am looking for someone,{03}and I need your help...{01}Do you know of a{03}knight called {11}{01}?{1E}{00}
You do? I must warn Sir{03}{11}{01} that he is in{03}danger most grievous...{01}Even now, Satrage,{03}Navampa, and Azart{03}are looking for him...{01}They wish to avenge{03}the loss he gave them{03}at Colosso.{02}{00}
A pity... The one I seek{03}won a battle at Colosso,{03}in Tolbi.{01}He won...and too easily,{03}perhaps. Now, his opponents{03}are eager for revenge.{02}{00}
I think {11}{01} must{03}be somewhere in the{03}Eastern Sea right now...{02}{00}
{11}{01}'s enemies are{03}gathering now, to destroy{03}him and erase their shame.{02}{00}
I fear what might happen{03}if the three find {11}{01}{03}before I can warn him...{02}{00}
Gaaaroooooo!{02}{00}
Aow-aow-oooo!!!{02}{00}
What was that!?{02}{00}
Awoooooo!!!{02}{00}
Ah-ah-awoooo!!!{02}{00}
Eeek!{02}{00}
I don't believe it!{03}Was that a{B0}{02}{00}
A what? Kraden, do you{03}know what that thing was?{02}{00}
Well... Perhaps...{02}{00}
So, what are you{03}waiting for!? Tell us!{02}{00}
I suspect it may have{03}been...a lycanthrope.{02}{00}
A lycanthwhat?{02}{00}
Just think of them as{03}a race of people born with{03}special powers...{02}{00}
Kind of like Adepts,{03}you mean?{02}{00}
Yes, that sounds right.{03}{11}{07}, you've put it{03}quite well.{02}{00}
Adepts borrow their{03}abilities from the power{03}of the elements...{02}{00}
While lycanthropes borrow{03}theirs from the power{03}of beasts...{02}{00}
This is why they{03}take the forms of{03}animals...{02}{00}
They may look{03}frightening...{01}But we must try to{03}communicate with them.{02}{00}
Lycanthropes...{03}Werewolves... A whole{03}village in hiding...{02}{00}
Is it just me...{01}Or does Kraden seem a{03}little TOO happy to have{03}found werewolves?{1E}{00}
What? Me? Happy to{03}find werewolves? You{03}must be joking!{02}{00}
I would love to study{03}them, but still...they{03}do frighten me...{02}{00}
I guess I'm just curious{03}about all of the secrets{03}of these new lands...{02}{00}
Any real scholar would be{03}thrilled to explore a new land{03}full of mystery, huh?{02}{00}
So, are there werewolves{03}only on Osenia?{02}{00}
Ummm...{02}{00}
If so, how could you{03}even have known about{03}them, Kraden?{02}{00}
Er... I, uh...{02}{00}
Yeah... That is weird.{02}{00}
All right, so I lied!{02}{00}
I'm glad we found{03}werewolves! There!{03}Are you happy!?{02}{00}
And you know what!?{03}I even want to get a{03}closer look if I can!{02}{00}
So let's go! Let's find{03}us some werewolves!{02}{00}
So, uh...you say you{03}saw a werewolf?{1E}{00}
Don't be ridiculous...{03}There's no such{03}thing as werewolves!{02}{00}
Of course not...{03}You should know there's{03}no such thing! Not here!{02}{00}
Good evening. Forgive{03}me for not taking my{03}hood off...{01}I just...don't care much{03}for the full moon's light.{02}{00}
Gaaaroooooo!{02}{00}
Gah! Whoops...{02}{00}
Heh heh hrrr...{03}I was just calling my{03}dog... Sounded good, huh?{02}{00}
You there...{03}Strangers should not{03}go about at night...{01}Guests are welcome in{03}Garoh, but they'd do{03}well to stay in at night.{02}{00}
Don't you love the{03}sight of the full moon?{1E}{00}
Yes, I agree...{03}But it brings me grief.{01}We here cannot{03}enjoy the sight{03}of it directly.{02}{00}
Heh hrr hrrr... Don't feel{03}like you must watch your{03}words on my account.{01}The full moon's light gives{03}birth to many strange{03}sights on nights like this.{02}{00}
It's grim luck that brings{03}strangers here in the{03}gloom of the full moon.{02}{00}
Such gorgeous moonlight...{03}If only I could take{03}off this hood...{02}{00}
Which one of us was it{03}who removed his hood in{03}front of these strangers?{02}{00}
Foreigners only come{03}here en route to Air's Rock.{01}Only a chosen few{03}can reach the peak.{02}{00}
The night of the full{03}moon is usually so{03}festive...{01}It's boring having to{03}wear these hoods{03}when strangers come...{02}{00}
What!? Outsiders, here?{02}{00}
Good evening, wanderers!{03}Are you looking for{03}something?{1E}{00}
Just...staying up late,{03}eh? Can't say I blame{03}you, on a night like this.{01}We here know the glory{03}of night of the full moon.{02}{00}
Searching for{03}werewolves, eh?{1E}{00}
You don't really{03}believe they exist,{03}do you?{01}If so, you'd best keep{03}it to yourself...{01}That is, if you don't{03}want to have folks here{03}howling with laughter...{02}{00}
Hehrrr... Sorry.{03}Just thought I'd ask.{01}We get some crazy folk{03}coming through here,{03}and I had to ask...{02}{00}
Our oldest son is always{03}scampering off late{03}at night... Where is he?{02}{00}
No fair! My brother{03}always gets to go{03}out late!{02}{00}
Outsiders could never{03}understand the gift the{03}moon has given us...{02}{00}
That pup of mine just{03}won't listen. He went out{03}when he shouldn't have...{01}He just wanted to see the{03}moonlight, and now his{03}father blames me for it!{02}{00}
What made Master{03}Maha take my brother{03}into the rock?{01}I want to see{03}what's in there...{02}{00}
Garoh exists to{03}protect Air's Rock.{01}In exchange, we gain{03}its power ourselves...{02}{00}
So you've heard of Whirlwind?{03}Most people haven't...{01}Even in Garoh, only a{03}chosen few can use it.{02}{00}
I've heard about the{03}Wind Stone...{01}Using Whirlwind on it{03}makes...something happen.{02}{00}
We have other powers{03}than just Whirlwind...{01}I wonder which of us{03}will inherit the powers{03}of Master Maha?{02}{00}
And different people use{03}Whirlwind different ways.{01}Master Maha's mastery{03}of Whirlwind would put{03}anyone to shame.{02}{00}
I wish I knew what{03}would happen...{03}Something weird, I guess.{02}{00}
When our people grow{03}older, they generate{03}strange powers...{01}Of course, I'm just a{03}wee pup, in people years...{02}{00}
My mate is close to{03}obtaining the power{03}he's been seeking...{02}{00}
I cast Whirlwind on the{03}stone, like I was{03}supposed to...{01}So why didn't I gain the{03}power that Maha wields?{02}{00}
If he succeeds and carries{03}on Master Maha's traditions,{03}I'll be so proud...{02}{00}
I'm sorry, but on nights{03}of the full moon, we only{03}sell claws and fangs.{01}You...probably wouldn't{03}have any use for those,{03}would you?{02}{00}
I should be outside,{03}howling with the pack,{03}not stuck in here!{02}{00}
Unfortunate that you{03}should come on a night{03}of the full moon, sir...{01}Come during the day{03}to see our full range{03}of wares...{02}{00}
These strangers seem{03}normal enough...{01}Except that they're{03}up late for outsiders...{02}{00}
Did you come here{03}from Alhafra?{1E}{00}
Really? You must have{03}gone through the cave...{01}You can't go back that{03}way, you know... The{03}return trip is longer.{02}{00}
Oh, so you must have{03}come by way of Mikasalla.{01}If you're going to Air's{03}Rock, take the crossroads{03}west of Alhafra.{02}{00}
I never change my stock,{03}unlike the weapons and{03}armor shopkeeps...{02}{00}
A clear night around here{03}always means fair weather{03}on the morrow...{01}You've come all this{03}way, so you might as{03}well go to Air's Rock, too...{02}{00}
Air's Rock can get quite{03}desolate. After all, it's in{03}the middle of a desert...{02}{00}
Zzzz... Zzzz...{03}What a waste...{03}Just a big rock...{02}{00}
Zzz... Whuzza? Whirlwind?{03}Wind Stone? Zzzzrrrgg...{02}{00}
It only rains a few{03}times a year there...{01}Air's Rock is in a desert,{03}so what else would{03}you expect?{02}{00}
Most people see nothing{03}of the true Air's Rock.{01}Our current guests{03}saw only the wind{03}and the dust...{02}{00}
...Climbed all over{03}that stupid rock, and{03}for what? Nothing!{02}{00}
That rock was huge.{03}How was I supposed{03}to make it spin?{02}{00}
The people here may{03}be different, but they{03}certainly are nice...{01}And those abilities of{03}theirs are amazing!{02}{00}
No matter what it takes,{03}I will save the souls of{03}those poor villagers...{02}{00}
Haowooo!!!{02}{00}
Aow-aow-oooo!!!{02}{00}
Look! It's that werewolf!{02}{00}
He was right there!{02}{00}
Let's go find him,{03}{11}{05}!{02}{00}
{11}{05}, wait...{02}{00}
Where could that{03}werewolf have gone?{02}{00}
Do you think we lost{03}him somewhere?{1E}{00}
That would be a shame...{02}{00}
I hope we didn't...{03}Or rather, I'd be quite{03}unhappy if we did...{02}{00}
Grrrr...{02}{00}
What was that?{02}{00}
It sounded like a wolf{03}growling, didn't it?{02}{00}
My hearing is not{03}so very good, but...{03}there was something.{02}{00}
Perhaps we should{03}search this area more{03}thoroughly...{02}{00}
There is no need...{02}{00}
Look... He's using Psynergy.{02}{00}
Garrrrooow...{02}{00}
Fear not...{03}This child is harmless.{02}{00}
He does look kind{03}of...small...{02}{00}
Grrrrrrr...{02}{00}
Tell me, who are you? How{03}did you come to be here?{02}{00}
I should like to ask you{03}the same question.{02}{00}
Could it be? Do you{03}outsiders possess the{03}power to reveal the unseen?{1E}{00}
Impossible...{03}Without Reveal, you could{03}not have entered this cave.{02}{00}
Of course... I was certain{03}that you must.{02}{00}
Grawooo...{02}{00}
Yes, you are correct. They{03}must have passed the{03}challenge of Air's Rock.{02}{00}
Er... How come that kid{03}doesn't talk, like you?{02}{00}
When we become werewolves,{03}speaking the human tongue{03}becomes more difficult.{02}{00}
But you can... You must{03}be someone special, then...{02}{00}
Hurh hurr hrrr... "Special"?{03}Perhaps.{05} Why don't you just{03}call me Maha...{02}{00}
So... I assume you also{03}can use Whirlwind...{02}{00}
If you learned Reveal on{03}Air's Rock, you must also{03}know Whirlwind.{1E}{00}
I don't think we need to hide{03}the fact that we're Adepts{03}from Maha...{02}{00}
That's right...{03}I think we can tell Maha{03}that we're Adepts.{02}{00}
Awooo...{02}{00}
What did he say?{03}I don't understand...{02}{00}
He wanted to know what{03}an Adept is... A question I{03}would like answered as well.{02}{00}
Adepts tap the power of{03}elemental energies to generate{03}forces like Whirlwind...{02}{00}
Elementals... You mean the{03}four elements, the powers of{03}earth and fire, water and wind?{02}{00}
That is correct. These elements{03}together comprise everything{03}in our world...{02}{00}
Interesting.{03}Very interesting...{02}{00}
Awooo...{02}{00}
Um... What did he{03}say that time?{02}{00}
He asked if there were{03}no longer any need to hide{03}from you...{02}{00}
...Why did he have to{03}hide in here in the{03}first place?{02}{00}
Aaah-Ah-Awoooh!{03}Hawawoooh!{02}{00}
No doubt, most would find{03}the sight of a werewolf{03}rather unnerving...{02}{00}
You are, sadly, correct.{03}Many consider ours an{03}accursed race.{02}{00}
And if they found you{03}in your werewolf form?{02}{00}
...Once, our people were{03}burned at the stake as{03}abominations...{01}They called this{03}"purification."{02}{00}
Horrible...{02}{00}
But...this little one...{03}He won't get excited{03}and try to bite, will he?{02}{00}
Child, return to{03}your home.{02}{00}
Arrooo?{02}{00}
Don't worry.{03}We can trust them...{03}Go back home now.{02}{00}
Aarrrooo?{02}{00}
They are Adepts, not unlike{03}us werewolves... They guard{03}an ancient secret.{02}{00}
We can trust them. They{03}will not betray us to{03}the world.{02}{00}
Woof.{02}{00}
It has grown quite late.{02}{00}
Why don't you go to{03}the inn and rest...{02}{00}
But then...{02}{00}
I will not leave{03}this place.{02}{00}
You aren't going home?{02}{00}
When I learned Reveal,{03}I lost my human form. The{03}wild is my home now.{02}{00}
So, Master Maha, you{03}always look this way?{02}{00}
And the little one?{02}{00}
The child changed because{03}he looked directly at the{03}full moon.{02}{00}
So, by tomorrow morning,{03}he will have returned{03}to his human form again?{02}{00}
Correct.{03}Now, let us retire.{02}{00}
I will tell the people of{03}Garoh that they need not{03}hide our secret from you.{02}{00}
One who can master Reveal{03}in human form... An Adept...{03}What a remarkable thing...{02}{00}
{11}{05} and party{03}stayed the night{03}at the inn.{02}{00}
You folks didn't sleep much{03}last night... You don't look{03}like you got any rest at all.{02}{00}
Master Maha told us all{03}about you. Don't you worry{03}about the bill. It's on us.{02}{00}
Farewell, friends.{02}{00}
I hear tell from Master{03}Maha that you guys are{03}special, too...{01}We don't have to hide{03}our secret from you{03}any longer!{02}{00}
Last night when you saw{03}me, I was wearing a hood.{01}I guess I won't have to{03}do that anymore!{02}{00}
Awoooooh!{02}{00}
Heh heh... Sorry about that!{03}I'm so happy I don't have{03}to hide that I howled out loud!{02}{00}
Maha said that you were the{03}only outsiders we could{03}share our secret with...{01}So...does it bother you that{03}we're all werewolves?{1E}{00}
Yeah, I thought so...{03}That's too bad.{01}I was so happy when Maha{03}told us. Now, I'm just{03}really disappointed. Arooo.{02}{00}
Wow! You guys really are{03}different from the others!{01}Most people run away{03}screaming or even grab{03}their weapons...{02}{00}
I heard there were other{03}werecreatures in Osenia,{03}in a few places...{01}...People who can turn{03}into other things than{03}wolves...{02}{00}
Hey, it's you guys!{03}Thanks for last night!{02}{00}
Oh, yeah... That's right...{03}You probably don't recognize{03}me in my human form!{02}{00}
I was in the cave with Maha!{03}I was that little werewolf!{02}{00}
I'm the reason you can{03}stay in our village and we{03}don't have to wear hoods!{02}{00}
How could these outsiders{03}have learned Reveal?{01}These guys must be{03}pretty unusual.{02}{00}
I thought we'd never be{03}able to talk to outsiders{03}about our secret...{01}I feel so free!{02}{00}
I never thought I'd be{03}so happy to have our{03}secret out in the open!{02}{00}
Maha said these travelers{03}were like us...{01}Does that mean they're{03}werewolves, too?{02}{00}
I would love to meet{03}other werecreatures{03}someday.{02}{00}
My dad told me I put the{03}whole village at risk...{03}He was really mad...{01}He said this whole thing{03}was just dumb luck... But{03}why would luck be dumb?{02}{00}
Hey! It's you!{03}Thanks for looking out{03}for our son last night!{01}But I'm curious... Did you{03}believe in werewolves{03}before you came here?{02}{00}
Everyone is amazed that{03}you learned Reveal{03}at Air's Rock!{01}If you have some time,{03}could you teach it{03}to our children?{02}{00}
My brother should have{03}gotten in trouble, but they{03}barely even got mad at him!{02}{00}
The younger the werewolf,{03}the less control he has{03}over his wolf form...{01}These travelers must have{03}been very brave to follow him.{02}{00}
Oh, thank goodness!{03}Everything worked out,{03}and my husband's not mad...{02}{00}
And dad said he was{03}really going to tan his hide{03}this time, too...{01}And now everyone's treating{03}him like he did some{03}amazingly good deed!{02}{00}
So you're something special?{03}An Adept, or something like{03}that?{01}Does that mean that you{03}can turn into a wolf or,{03}something, like us?{02}{00}
You learned Reveal at{03}Air's Rock and lived to{03}tell the tale...{01}So that must mean...{03}you can use Whirlwind.{02}{00}
I just can't believe that{03}someone outside the{03}village learned Reveal...{02}{00}
Did Maha mean that they{03}could change forms, like{03}we can?{02}{00}
So these people can use{03}both Reveal and Whirlwind...{01}They must be powerful,{03}like Master Maha is.{02}{00}
Normally, outsiders never{03}get in to see Maha, but{03}these people...{01}They can see him{03}whenever they want...{02}{00}
You... Is it true that{03}you learned Reveal?{1E}{00}
Hmm...I thought Air's{03}Rock belonged to my{03}people alone...{01}But you young outsiders{03}have mastered it so quickly...{03}I might as well quit trying.{02}{00}
No, I can tell it was you{03}they're talking about... I can{03}smell Air's Rock on you...{01}Ah, but you're so young!{03}And I am so very old...{03}I might as well quit trying.{02}{00}
To think I've wasted so much of{03}my life on something you{03}did in a single afternoon...{02}{00}
He's worked so hard...{03}But now, I don't know...{03}He seems so sad...{02}{00}
I thought I could become a{03}leader if I learned Reveal.{03}How foolish of me.{02}{00}
So now, even outsiders{03}are learning Reveal...{01}How do we decide who{03}will lead Garoh now?{02}{00}
What do you think? I'll bet{03}these weapons suit you{03}better than any fangs would!{02}{00}
I prefer the tooth and claw,{03}myself, but whatever...{02}{00}
When we change form,{03}it's best to be unclothed.{01}But when you're human,{03}armor always comes in handy.{02}{00}
Maha says that when we're{03}wolves, we don't need to{03}wear armor...{01}He says our instincts{03}will protect us.{02}{00}
I've heard stories about{03}other mountains like our{03}own Air's Rock...{01}Like on this island that{03}lies across the Eastern{03}Sea, far from Osenia...{02}{00}
I heard that one that's{03}across the Eastern Sea{03}is really pretty, too.{01}It's got water spilling down{03}the sides in huge torrents.{03}Sounds lovely...{02}{00}
If you can pass the tests{03}of Air's Rock, you can do{03}anything!{02}{00}
Maha came along{03}and said the nicest{03}things about you all.{02}{00}
Those wolves were{03}really noisy last{03}night, too.{02}{00}
Maybe we should stay{03}and try climbing Air's Rock{03}one more time.{02}{00}
I've heard stories about{03}other places like Air's{03}Rock...{01}If they can handle Air's{03}Rock, they can probably{03}handle those too.{02}{00}
He said if they were{03}werewolves, he'd want them{03}to take his place...{01}They must have made{03}quite an impression on{03}Maha for him to say that.{02}{00}
I'm scared of wolves,{03}so I don't go out much{03}at night...{02}{00}
If I used a lever, I{03}could probably make{03}that rock spin...{01}But I still don't get what{03}the point of it is...{02}{00}
I've heard about you.{03}They say you're special,{03}like the people in this town.{02}{00}
Am I the only one here{03}who isn't special!?{01}Please, won't somebody{03}answer my wishes and{03}make me special, too?{02}{00}
Ah, you came...{02}{00}
I've been waiting for you.{02}{00}
Would you mind telling me a{03}little more about werewolves?{02}{00}
You want to know the reason{03}we possess the power to{03}transform into beasts?{02}{00}
Ah... Well, {05}I, er...{03}Actually, yes.{02}{00}
Do you find it strange{03}that we can change our{03}shapes?{02}{00}
Well, ummm... Yes.{02}{00}
But surely changing one's{03}shape is not really all that{03}unusual.{02}{00}
What are you getting at?{02}{00}
Think about the caterpillar{03}for a moment.{01}When the time is right,{03}does it not transform into{03}a beautiful butterfly?{02}{00}
Well, yes. It's only natural...{02}{00}
And the pill bug and hedgehog?{03}Do they not change their{03}shapes to protect themselves?{02}{00}
I have heard of these{03}creatures, yes...{02}{00}
And many amphibians possess{03}the power to change color{03}at will, correct?{02}{00}
In light of all this, do you{03}mean to tell me you find{03}werewolves so abnormal?{02}{00}
Hrmm, well... To be honest,{03}I hadn't thought of it that{03}way before...{02}{00}
Perhaps you simply did not{03}give it enough thought.{02}{00}
How insulting! I, sir...{03}am a SCIENTIST!{02}{00}
Indeed! A scientist?{03}That {09}{02}is{07} impressive.{02}{00}
I have spent a great{03}deal of time thinking{03}about werewolves.{02}{00}
For a time, I even felt{03}cursed to have been{03}born a werewolf...{02}{00}
But after taking a more{03}objective look at nature...{02}{00}
I realized that weaker{03}species have survived by{03}evolving...by transforming.{01}Don't you agree?{02}{00}
Think about it for a moment.{03}Without changing their bodies{03}with weapons and armor...{01}Humans would be very{03}weak creatures indeed.{02}{00}
I believe that evolving into{03}werewolves is just one way{03}for humanity to survive...{02}{00}
But that's...{02}{00}
Of course, there's{03}no way I can prove{03}this theory.{02}{00}
But I felt that our ability{03}to use Whirlwind was{03}evidence of this.{02}{00}
Whirlwind? Why?{02}{00}
I had thought only the{03}people of Garoh could{03}use Whirlwind.{02}{00}
It was a gift known{03}only to werewolves, to{03}Garoh's pack...{02}{00}
And that only a chosen few{03}could use Reveal...{02}{00}
But now I find that you,{03}too, can use these... What{03}does it all mean?{02}{00}
Why are you able to use{03}Whirlwind, and what is{03}an Adept?{02}{00}
Master Maha, do you know of{03}a continent called Angara? It{03}lies far north of the Eastern Sea.{02}{00}
Angara?{02}{00}
In the middle of Angara, there{03}is a peak called Mt. Aleph.{02}{00}
Mt. Aleph? ...Then it's true!{03}Our legends say this peak has{03}stood since this world began!{02}{00}
If Mt. Aleph does exist, then{03}perhaps our legends are true!{02}{00}
It does exist...{02}{00}
These two hail from the{03}village at the base of Mt. Aleph,{03}a village called Vale.{02}{00}
They come from Mt. Aleph!?{03}Incredible!{02}{00}
And they are both Adepts.{03}And while their powers{03}may vary...{01}Everyone from Vale is an{03}Adept to a certain degree.{02}{00}
Then, does that not make{03}them like us in Garoh?{02}{00}
In Vale, the myths say that{03}Mt. Aleph itself gave birth{03}to the Adepts...{02}{00}
This is not what the legends{03}of Garoh tell us...{02}{00}
As a people, they are{03}quite gifted...but it goes{03}far beyond that...{02}{00}
The mystical stones on{03}Mt. Aleph... The Psynergy{03}Stones...{01}They are closely linked to{03}the powers of the townsfolk.{02}{00}
"Psynergy Stones," you say?{02}{00}
If there were similar stones{03}in Garoh, it might explain{03}your powers as well.{02}{00}
And what manner of stones{03}are these Psynergy Stones?{02}{00}
You've seen them, Maha!{03}The shining stone at the{03}heart of Air's Rock.{02}{00}
I know the stone you{03}speak of, but...{02}{00}
Air's Rock is quite far{03}from Garoh.{02}{00}
I don't see how it could{03}affect the people here.{02}{00}
I wonder... Could it be{03}the wind?{1E}{00}
You probably figured{03}it out for yourself already,{03}{11}{05}.{02}{00}
I guess I couldn't have{03}expected you to understand,{03}{11}{05}...{02}{00}
There were strong winds blowing{03}within Air's Rock... Those winds{03}would carry far...{02}{00}
Carry? Carry what?{02}{00}
Ugh! You're so dense!{03}The power of the Psynergy{03}Stone!{02}{00}
How is that possible? How{03}could the stone's power{03}be carried on the wind?{02}{00}
Do not belittle the{03}power of the wind!{02}{00}
Given time, the wind can{03}grind great mountains down{03}to sand!{02}{00}
I mean, the wind at Air's{03}Rock was strong enough{03}to blow us off the ground!{02}{00}
So why couldn't the wind{03}carry particles of the stone{03}all the way to Garoh?{02}{00}
She's right!{00}
She's right!{00}
Those particles from the{03}Psynergy Stone must be{03}charged with its power!{02}{00}
This explains why your{03}Psynergy is weaker than{03}that of Vale's people...{01}You've been exposed{03}to smaller particles.{02}{00}
The wind patterns might{03}also affect who among us{03}in Garoh can use Whirlwind.{02}{00}
Of course, this is all mere{03}conjecture, but it does offer{03}us some clues...{02}{00}
Thank you, umm...{02}{00}
It's {11}{07}.{03}I'm pleased to meet you.{02}{00}
Oh! Haven't we given you{03}our names, Master Maha?{02}{00}
I am Kraden.{02}{00}
This is {11}{06}...{02}{00}
{11}{08}...{02}{00}
And {11}{05}.{02}{00}
You must permit me to thank{03}you for all you've done.{02}{00}
No, no, please... We don't{03}need any thanks...{02}{00}
That's too bad... I was{03}going to give you this.{02}{00}
It's a Djinni!{02}{00}
A "Djinni"? Is that{03}what you call them?{02}{00}
When he is with you,{03}he adds to your power.{03}He is very helpful.{02}{00}
I suppose you'll be continuing{03}your journey now?{1E}{00}
So you intend to travel by{03}sea? That is a long journey...{02}{00}
So, you still can't tell just{03}what sort of journeys{03}await you...{02}{00}
In that case, I think you{03}will get more use out of{03}this "Djinni" than I will.{02}{00}
{12}{01} got the{03}Djinni {81}~.{02}{00}
Another Djinni!{03}Talk about lucky!{02}{00}
This is a great gift.{03}We are quite thankful.{02}{00}
You don't need to thank{03}me. Just take care on{03}your travels.{02}{00}
Good luck with the...{03}werewolf thing, Maha...{02}{00}
Well, {11}{05}, we must{03}be going now.{02}{00}
Take care in your{03}travels, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
I wish that I were free{03}to travel the world, like{03}{11}{05} and his friends.{02}{00}
{11}{05} checked the{03}tablet. It has strange{03}characters written on it.{01}Wielder of Wind's might...{03}Lay your hands upon this stone.{01}We bestow upon thee{03}the power to see the{03}truth unclouded...{02}{00}
Do you think I ought{03}to touch it?{02}{00}
{11}{07} touched the tablet.{02}{00}
{11}{05} checked the{03}Psynergy Stone.{02}{00}
Everyone's PP{03}was replenished!{02}{00}
Beware the Wind Stones.{01}The stones magnify the power{03}of the wind. Use caution when{03}approaching Air's Rock.{02}{00}
There's something inside{03}the cracked ice...{02}{00}
We followed the pirates{03}here from Madra...{01}Are you going to{03}Alhafra, too?{1E}{00}
I don't think you can{03}get there through{03}the desert...{01}You probably should've{03}crossed the bridge you{03}passed on the way here.{02}{00}
You guys are lucky. We've{03}gotta find some way{03}through this desert.{02}{00}
If that accursed pirate Briggs{03}hadn't smashed the bridge,{03}we wouldn't be here!{01}Maybe we won't find him,{03}but I promise you {11}{08}{03}will pay the price for him!{02}{00}
{09}{04}Ooooh...{07} This desert...{03}It's so hot out here!{03}I feel dizzy!{02}{00}
Water... My throat is{03}so parched! *Gasp!*{03}...It's no use...{02}{00}
Can't we just forget{03}about Briggs?{02}{00}
No. I'm not about to{03}quit looking for him.{02}{00}
There must be some{03}way through this desert!{03}We must press onward!{02}{00}
As you can see, the{03}elder is quite insistent{03}on finding a way through.{01}He feels the only way{03}to Alhafra is through{03}this desert...{02}{00}
This is where my son{03}must prove himself{03}as mayor...{01}So, Son. How are you{03}planning to get us{03}through this desert{01}and on to Alhafra?{02}{00}
Father, how am I supposed{03}to get us through the{03}desert?{01}I think you're over-{03}estimating my abilities.{02}{00}
Briggs and the Champa{03}are nowhere to be seen.{02}I wonder if they actually{03}made it to Alhafra...{02}{00}
That {11}{08} is SO one of{03}the Champa... We don't need{03}Briggs to prove it.{01}When we get back home,{03}he's gonna pay for{03}helping Briggs.{02}{00}
Sure, it's hot. But it's{03}a dry heat...{05}and{03}I can't stand it!{01}I want to go somewhere{03}cool and just relax!{02}{00}
There's a spring over{03}there, but we can't{03}reach it...{01}I can hear Fate{03}mocking us.{02}{00}
We've reached a{03}dead end...{01}I just want to go{03}home to Madra.{02}{00}
My son is in quite{03}a fix, but I'm not{03}going to help him.{01}Only by overcoming{03}adversity can he ever{03}become a strong leader.{02}{00}
My father's always telling{03}me to overcome adversity,{03}but he never tells me how!{01}I don't understand why{03}we can't just go home and{03}forget about Alhafra.{02}{00}
Hey! Look! Up there!{02}{00}
How did those guys{03}get up there?{02}{00}
Maybe there's a path{03}up ahead that we{03}missed...{02}{00}
Maybe... Maybe we can{03}get through the desert{03}after all!{02}{00}
We can find a way{03}through to Alhafra!{02}{00}
I don't care where we{03}go, as long as it's cool.{02}{00}
Hey! I found it!{03}I found a way through!{02}{00}
At last, we can get{03}through this accursed{03}desert!{01}Except that the elder{03}and the others need{03}to rest before we go.{02}{00}
I was certain this was a{03}dead end. What's wrong{03}with this desert?{01}This is only delaying{03}{11}{08}'s punishment...{02}{00}
I'm just glad we're{03}finally able to rest.{01}It doesn't feel like{03}my brain is on fire{03}anymore...{02}{00}
Oh, man! This is the{03}best water I've ever{03}tasted! Yowza!{02}{00}
Osenia is so much{03}larger than I'd thought...{01}I wonder how much{03}farther it is to Alhafra.{02}{00}
My son...has passed his{03}first test as mayor.{01}I'll have to congratulate{03}him. Eventually. Now, to{03}see if his luck holds up.{02}{00}
If we remain here much{03}longer, Briggs will be{03}beyond our reach...{01}We have to press on{03}just a little farther...{02}{00}
Oh, not again!{03}Don't tell me they{03}want to rest again!{02}{00}
My job is to find{03}evidence that {11}{08}{03}is a Champa.{01}The elder is with us,{03}so I wouldn't dream{03}of lying...{02}{00}
Maybe we should have{03}the mayor go on ahead{03}while we rest here...{02}{00}
I don't want to leave!{03}At least let me fill up{03}on water before we go.{02}{00}
How much longer will{03}we be walking, anyway?{01}I feel like we've walked{03}off the edge of the{03}world as it is...{02}{00}
Regardless of what{03}happens next, know that{03}you have done well, my son.{02}{00}
Hooo... I can't believe{03}we're going to all this{03}trouble for a stranger...{01}I'm still not convinced that{03}{11}{08} isn't one of{03}Briggs's henchmen...{02}{00}
North: Alhafra{03}South: Air's Rock{01}Warning: Beyond this{03}point, there is no{03}route back.{02}{00}
Welcome to Alhafra. This is{03}the largest town in western{03}Osenia...{01}You can find anything you{03}need here! ...Unless you{03}need a boat, that is...{02}{00}
A massive tidal wave{03}hit us and destroyed{03}every ship in Alhafra.{02}{00}
I hear the tidal wave{03}knocked Indra into Osenia.{03}Is that true?{1E}{00}
Really? It's just so hard{03}to believe, you know?{01}Still, that would explain the{03}massive jolt we felt right{03}after the tidal wave hit.{02}{00}
I was hoping a traveler like{03}you might have a better idea{03}of what happened... Oh well...{02}{00}
I guess what those men{03}told me was true...{01}I'd figured they were just{03}playing a joke on me, so I{03}ignored them all...{02}{00}
Right after my boat got crushed,{03}a group of men came by asking{03}if I had one for sale.{01}They were pretty swarthy,{03}like they might have been{03}sailors or something.{02}{00}
This guy's probably wondering{03}about that boat sitting down{03}at the pier...{01}It still floats, but I don't{03}think the thing can move...{02}{00}
Losing our boats was awful...{01}But I feel so bad for all the{03}people whose houses were{03}destroyed by the tidal wave.{02}{00}
I just can't believe a single tidal{03}wave could cause an entire{03}continent to move like that.{01}But I used to be able to see{03}Indra to the north of us, and{03}it's definitely not there...{02}{00}
Those guys looking for a{03}boat sure were in a hurry.{03}I wonder why...{01}Hey, at least I was able{03}to unload that boat with{03}the busted mast on them.{02}{00}
Finally! We made it!{02}{00}
We-We're here?{02}{00}
Where's the Elder?{02}{00}
He's coming now...{02}{00}
Haaa hoo hooo...{03}Are we...here? I feel like{03}I just walked 500 miles.{02}{00}
I'm fine... I feel like I{03}could walk 500 more!{02}{00}
So...is this Alhafra?{02}{00}
Madra's a pretty big place,{03}but this town is huge!{02}{00}
We didn't come to Alhafra{03}to shop, Mister Mayor.{02}{00}
We're here to bring in{03}Briggs the Champa.{02}{00}
I know that!{02}{00}
Then we should go{03}straight to speak with{03}Alhafra's mayor.{02}{00}
We're in no shape to go{03}present ourselves to{03}the mayor right now!{02}{00}
Look, Briggs is obviously{03}not here, and besides, we{03}already know {11}{08} is{B0}{02}{00}
Silence!{02}{00}
It seems Alhafra has felt{03}the effects of the tidal{03}wave as well...{02}{00}
It looks like they suffered{03}a good deal of damage...{02}{00}
That would explain why{03}Alhafra doesn't seem to have{03}any boats for sale, either!{02}{00}
You know, just looking around,{03}I get the impression they only{03}had one boat to begin with!{02}{00}
So if you really needed a{03}boat, the only way to get{03}one would be to steal it.{01}Hmmm... But wouldn't that{03}cause quite an uproar?{02}{00}
...Which means the pirates{03}must still be here, trying{03}to get a boat!{02}{00}
So, you think we've actually{03}caught up with Briggs?{02}{00}
No doubt about it!{02}{00}
That's why I want to meet{03}the mayor of Alhafra before{03}the Champa steal a ship.{02}{00}
Oh yeah... I get it now.{03}In that case, let's go see{03}Alhafra's mayor right away.{02}{00}
Um... Say, excuse me...{02}{00}
Where would we find the{03}mayor of Alhafra?{02}{00}
Uh... The mayor?{02}{00}
Just keep going down{03}this road. It's the last{03}house. You can't miss it.{02}{00}
Those men didn't look like{03}they were from Osenia...{01}I wonder what business{03}they have in Alhafra...{02}{00}
Those people that just{03}came through looked{03}totally exhausted.{01}You don't suppose they passed{03}through the Yampi Desert to get{03}here, do you?{02}{00}
We've had a lot of{03}strangers coming{03}through here lately.{02}{00}
Our port was ruined by the{03}tidal wave, so kids aren't{03}allowed there anymore...{01}But all I want to do is just{03}see what kind of wind is{03}blowing in off the sea...{02}{00}
The only boat spared by the{03}tidal wave is that newfangled{03}ship that catches wind in a sail.{01}The thing is...the mast that{03}holds up the sail got snapped{03}apart!{02}{00}
Let me guess... You're here{03}because you want to buy{03}a canoe, right?{1E}{00}
Sorry, but I'm totally backlogged{03}with preorders. I'm gonna be up{03}late finishing these as it is...{02}{00}
That's good, because{03}I've got a ton of work{03}to do already...{01}And then I have to head{03}down to the wharf and{03}help clean up the wreck...{02}{00}
That boat at the wharf uses{03}a sail, so it's more efficient{03}than any galley.{01}But since the mast is broken,{03}it's not going anywhere.{03}What a waste.{02}{00}
Why would the mayor go and{03}sell our boat to a bunch of{03}foreigners?{01}I know it's got a broken{03}mast, but come on!{02}{00}
...{02}{00}
If this guy's looking to buy{03}a boat, he's looking in the{03}wrong town...{01}I already sold the last boat in{03}town, and it had a broken mast!{02}{00}
Who would come to Alhafra{03}across the Yampi Desert? It's{03}way too dangerous!{01}Anyone with half a brain{03}would've just taken the{03}bridge to the northwest...{02}{00}
This tidal wave's actually been{03}good for Alhafra. The town is{03}bustling with activity...{01}I think I'll steer clear of those{03}swarthy men at the wharf,{03}though... They're a scary lot!{02}{00}
I don't know why they won't{03}let us kids go down to see{03}the dock...{01}I wanna see what kind of{03}damage the tidal wave did!{02}{00}
I wonder if my partner has{03}finished up that canoe yet...{01}The sooner he finishes, the{03}sooner we can clean things{03}up down at the jetty.{02}{00}
We can't raise the mast{03}until we get rid of the debris.{01}But I can't help get rid of{03}the debris until I finish at{03}least this one last canoe!{02}{00}
I still can't believe those{03}guys wanted to buy my{03}busted boat! One man's junk...{02}{00}
It may be newfangled, but{03}it's no good if it's broken.{01}Forget technology! I'm{03}sticking with boats with{03}oars! No masts for me!{02}{00}
Ooo... This ain't good!{02}{00}
That guy looked like the{03}mayor of Madra...{02}{00}
He must have come here{03}looking for Briggs.{02}{00}
I'd better go tell the others!{02}{00}
What's your problem?{03}What are you, some{03}kind of freak?{02}{00}
Well? What!? You got{03}a problem with me?{1E}{00}
Ah, who cares what you{03}think? I've got stuff to do,{03}so scram, kid!{02}{00}
So where do you get off{03}invading my personal space,{03}huh? Scram, stinkbreath!{02}{00}
Where was I? Oh yeah,{03}I was going to tell them{03}about the mayor of Madra!{02}{00}
I don't care if it WAS broken!{03}The mayor shouldn't have up{03}and sold the town's only boat!{02}{00}
Those guys who bought the{03}boat looked kinda shabby...{01}But I hear they paid the{03}mayor a whole wad of cash{03}for it...{02}{00}
I wonder if the mayor{03}will use that money to{03}repair our poor town...{02}{00}
Why would anyone pay so{03}much for a broken old boat?{01}I know I shouldn't be so{03}suspicious, but there's{03}something odd about them...{02}{00}
We're taking care of some{03}people whose house was{03}destroyed by the tidal wave.{01}But...they're just so demanding!{03}My wife feels so overwhelmed{03}that she can't take it anymore!{02}{00}
Augh! With all these demanding{03}houseguests, I feel like I've{03}lost control of my own house!{02}{00}
Aren't you thirsty,{03}my dear?{02}{00}
Oh, you're right, dear.{03}I am!{02}{00}
Sorry to bother you, but{03}we'd like some tea.{02}{00}
Are you talking to me?!{02}{00}
If you want tea, you can go{03}right ahead and fix it yourself!{02}{00}
Well! I say! It seems the lady{03}of the house is no lady at all!{02}{00}
When we lost our house in the{03}tidal wave, the master of this{03}house offered his home to us.{01}But living with another family{03}isn't easy. Hahhh... They're{03}absolutely exhausting!{02}{00}
I just wish that old man{03}would stop pestering my{03}wife all the time!{02}{00}
I don't mind helping people{03}in need, but I won't be taken{03}advantage of...{02}{00}
All I ask is for a little tea,{03}and that's the behavior I get!?{01}I just want to get out of this{03}inhospitable house and back{03}into my own sweet home...{02}{00}
Is this how a young bride{03}treats her husband these{03}days?{01}Back in my day, we were{03}never like that!{02}{00}
We were hit by a wave so{03}strong that it swept homes{03}off their foundations!{01}What's worse is, all my best{03}weapons were washed out{03}to sea!{02}{00}
Losing all my most expensive{03}items may well ruin my business{03}entirely...{02}{00}
That tidal wave may well wash{03}out both my business and the{03}weapon shopkeeper's!{02}{00}
It doesn't matter how well-{03}crafted a suit of armor is... If{03}you soak it in seawater, it's junk.{01}All my furs are ruined... All my{03}steel is rusted. It's nothing but{03}garbage now...{02}{00}
Don't mention the tidal wave{03}to the other merchants...{01}It did a lot of damage, and{03}we'd really just rather not{03}talk about it, you know?{02}{00}
If all my goods were damaged{03}by seawater, they'd be useless.{03}I'd have to throw them all away...{01}I'm lucky the wave{03}missed my shop.{02}{00}
Maybe you've noticed, but a lot{03}of folk here lost their homes in{03}the wave, but don't mind them.{02}{00}
You see how full our inn is?{03}You'd think we'd be making{03}money hand over fist...{01}But that's not true... We just{03}don't have the heart to charge{03}the people who lost their homes.{02}{00}
The town ought to give money{03}to all the people who suffered{03}from the tidal wave...{01}That way, maybe the innkeeper{03}could afford to make us{03}better food...{02}{00}
I can't believe the innkeeper{03}is renting out more rooms{03}when we're as busy as this.{02}{00}
The innkeeper told me to use{03}only the cheapest ingredients{03}to help save money.{02}{00}
The innkeeper serves his{03}paying guests better meals{03}than we Alhafrans get.{01}That's so cheap! I want{03}gourmet meals, too!{02}{00}
We're all guests in the same{03}inn, so why is my meal{03}so awful?{01}At the very least, they should{03}let us go back for seconds{03}of that stinking slop!{02}{00}
Ohhh... I'm hungry...{03}My tummy hurts...{03}When's dinnertime?{02}{00}
I don't think I've had a bite{03}of meat or fish ever since{03}setting foot in this inn.{02}{00}
I'll never forgive the mayor{03}for failing to come to our aid{03}when we were all suffering...{01}I wonder what I can do to{03}make him suffer...{02}{00}
Our guests are very upset{03}with the mayor. I just hope{03}they don't do anything...rash...{02}{00}
My pop's been lookin' around,{03}an' he says the mayor keeps{03}all his treasure underground.{01}He says it's south of the{03}palace, but that's all{03}I know about it.{02}{00}
Why do we all have{03}to be cooped up in{03}such a small room?{01}How am I supposed to sleep{03}with Grandpa grinding his{03}teeth all night?{02}{00}
We all have to bear the{03}discomfort of this place until{03}our homes are repaired.{02}{00}
I heard there's only one person{03}staying in the room next door.{01}Can't they just move one more{03}person into that room? Like me?{02}{00}
So, you've finally come.{02}{00}
I had suspected we might run{03}into each other again, since{03}we both are looking for boats.{02}{00}
Unfortunately, the only boat{03}this town possesses has{03}already been sold.{02}{00}
I will be resting here in Alhafra{03}a bit longer. I have traveled long{03}and hard, and I am weary.{02}{00}
Perhaps we can get along{03}at least until we both depart.{02}{00}
The broken mast on the{03}ship they sold won't be{03}easily fixed.{01}That is, as long as we Adepts{03}don't do anything about it.{02}{00}
I never imagined anyone from{03}Alhafra would ever stay at{03}my inn.{02}{00}
Perhaps the mayor will cover{03}the cost of lodging everyone so{03}we can feed them a decent meal.{01}We're just trying to be helpful,{03}but we're the ones who end up{03}looking cheap.{02}{00}
I bet the master of the inn{03}could afford to give us better{03}food than he's been giving us.{02}{00}
I can't believe the innkeeper{03}is cramming all those poor{03}people into that tiny room.{01}He certainly can't badmouth{03}the mayor...they're both stingy!{02}{00}
I can't believe I'm only{03}supposed to feed the{03}villagers vegetable dishes.{02}{00}
Maybe it's 'cause all we've{03}been eating is vegetables, but{03}I just never seem to fill up.{02}{00}
I think I've lost weight from{03}all these vegetables!{01}Sure, I'm looking skinnier than{03}ever, but something tells me{03}this just isn't healthy.{02}{00}
Maybe I'm just hungry, but{03}everything they put in front{03}of me looks delicious.{01}I'm so hungry I could eat{03}my own hand...{02}{00}
*Sniff sniff*{03}That smell! That's the smell{03}of fish... No! Now I'm drooling!{02}{00}
I hope the mayor's treasure{03}room doesn't run too close{03}to the prison...{01}If those thieves found out{03}about it, they'd dig their way{03}out in no time flat!{02}{00}
I know our mayor's bad, but{03}he wouldn't stoop to stealing{03}from his own people, would he?{02}{00}
Everyone says the hill beneath{03}the mayor's mansion is full of{03}tunnels. I wonder if that's true.{02}{00}
I think they put me next to{03}Grandpa so they wouldn't have{03}to listen to him grind his teeth.{02}{00}
When you're living packed in{03}together like this, you're bound{03}to get on each other's nerves.{01}I just hope everything goes{03}back to normal once we move{03}back into our own homes.{02}{00}
That warrior next door{03}is so suave and handsome,{03}just how I like 'em.{01}I hope we can be friends.{02}{00}
Really, I do wish you would{03}quit using your Mind Read{03}on me...{01}Trust me, my thoughts will{03}become all too clear in{03}due time...{02}{00}
!{02}{00}
In the middle of Osenia, there's{03}a terrible village where they{03}worship a foul and vengeful god.{02}{00}
The people of Garoh brought{03}the curse upon themselves for{03}worshipping their wicked god...{02}{00}
Everything's so boring here...{03}Why doesn't anybody do{03}anything...criminal?{02}{00}
I don't know why there are so{03}many outsiders in Alhafra now,{03}but it's bound to mean trouble.{02}{00}
Did you want to see the mayor?{1E}{00}
Sorry, but he's meeting with{03}some visitors from Madra{03}right now...{01}Maybe you can see him once{03}he's finished with them.{02}{00}
The mayor is very open to{03}meeting visitors, but he's in{03}an important meeting now...{01}So it's probably good that{03}you're not here to see him...{02}{00}
Listen, you look like an OK{03}guy, and I'd love to let you{03}through, but I just can't...{01}I mean, if I let you in, then I'd{03}have to let everyone in, right?{03}I'm sorry, but it wouldn't be fair.{02}{00}
I hate my job. I always{03}have to be so tough and{03}secretive around people.{01}Deep down inside, all I{03}really want to do is read{03}them some of my poetry...{02}{00}
My partner's always in such{03}a bad mood... Maybe I should{03}bake him a cake...{02}{00}
No one is allowed beyond this point.{03}Don't even think about it.{02}{00}
The mayor said no one goes{03}through, and I mean to make{03}sure no one goes through!{02}{00}
It's... It's no use!{02}{00}
The mast just won't budge,{03}no matter how many people{03}we get to help us!{02}{00}
We're going to have to get{03}all this junk off the mast{03}first.{02}{00}
If we could just get some{03}decent footing, we could have{03}this thing clear in no time!{02}{00}
There's more to it than{03}that, though...{02}{00}
We still have to do something{03}about that rope over there.{02}{00}
Untangling that'll be a piece{03}of cake, once we get a boat{03}we can use...{02}{00}
Oh, yeah... A piece of cake...{03}Except for that huge{03}rock over there!{02}{00}
Oh yeah... The rock...{02}{00}
How are we supposed to{03}get the mast out from{03}under that thing? It's huge!{02}{00}
There's no way we're gonna{03}move it by ourselves...{02}{00}
Well, either way, we can't{03}do anything until Zack{03}finishes the canoe.{02}{00}
What's your problem?{02}{00}
You're new in town,{03}aren't you?{1E}{00}
Well, I've never seen you{03}before, but whatever...{02}{00}
You're probably curious{03}about this here ship, huh?{1E}{00}
Masted ships like this were{03}originally built by the Champa...{03}Oh, forget it. It's lost on you.{02}{00}
They call this a "sailing"{03}ship... Wind is the only{03}thing that'll make it move...{01}Isn't that incredible?{1E}{00}
You kids today, with your{03}"been there, done that"{03}attitudes... It's a shame...{02}{00}
Yeah, well, think how surprised{03}we were to find that Alhafra{03}had learned to build sailing ships!{01}I suppose the age when anyone{03}could sail the seas was{03}bound to come someday.{02}{00}
We paid big money for this{03}ship. It's ours now, so don't{03}you go cryin' about it.{02}{00}
We sent my pal into town{03}to get some supplies, but{03}he came back looking pale...{01}He went straight down{03}to talk to Briggs, and{03}I haven't seen him since...{02}{00}
If we could just raise the{03}mast, we could head back{03}to Champa...{02}{00}
People call us Champa a{03}seafaring people because{03}we make sailboats...{01}And sure, maybe we{03}do a little pillaging on{03}the side...{01}But now that Alhafra can{03}build sailboats, Briggs's{03}pirating days may be ending.{02}{00}
I thought it would be easy{03}to right the mast, but I think{03}I must have been crazy...{02}{00}
That lousy rat... If something{03}happened back there, he{03}should have told all of us!{01}Now I can't stop worrying...{03}What's taking him so long!?{02}{00}
When I think about how long it{03}will be until we go home,{03}I miss Champa all the more.{01}I'm just glad nobody in{03}Champa knows we're pirates.{02}{00}
The mayor of Madra? Here?{02}{00}
You're certain?{02}{00}
How did he know we{03}came to Alhafra?{02}{00}
He knew we needed a ship,{03}and he knew we went east.{03}It seems pretty easy to me.{02}{00}
Arr... Well, yeah... When you put{03}it that way, it does make sense...{02}{00}
He was looking to find{03}the mayor of Alhafra...{02}{00}
He must be hoping the mayor{03}will tell him where we are...{02}{00}
He'll probably tell the Alhafrans{03}we're pirates, too, huh?{02}{00}
Pirates!? That seems a{03}little unfair!{02}{00}
What do you mean? We{05}.{05}.{05}.are{03}pirates, aren't we?{01}I mean, we've taken all sorts{03}of stuff that didn't belong to us.{02}{00}
That's only because everyone in{03}Champa would starve otherwise!{03}We don't have any choice.{02}{00}
Ah...{02}{00}
And even then, it's never a lot.{02}{00}
Wha-What's not?{02}{00}
The stuff we take. We never{03}take too much from any one{03}town.{02}{00}
Yeah, I guess not...{02}{00}
And why do you think that is?{02}{00}
Er... Why?{02}{00}
Because you never can tell{03}how these wealthy towns will{03}react. It's too risky, right?{02}{00}
Hey, yeah! Which is why we{03}didn't steal anything from{03}Alhafra...{02}{00}
Right! That's why we avoid the{03}risky towns and just take what{03}we need from the others!{02}{00}
See? That's why you're our{03}captain, Briggs! You've got{03}brains coming out your ears!{02}{00}
Hmph! There's nothing{03}brainy about that!{02}{00}
Did you hear that? It sounded{03}like a girl! Who's out there!?{02}{00}
What do you think you're doing?{02}{00}
Don't you know that someone{03}has been falsely imprisoned{03}for your crimes?{02}{00}
Er... What's your point?{02}{00}
You have to come with{03}us and attest to that{03}man's innocence!{02}{00}
And...why would I want to{03}do something like that?{02}{00}
Oh-ho! I was hoping we could{03}avoid any ugliness, but you{03}leave us no choice!{02}{00}
We'll bring you in against your{03}will if we must, but either way,{03}you're coming with us!{02}{00}
Isn't that right, {11}{05}?{1E}{00}
Good for you! Let's teach{03}these guys a lesson!{02}{00}
After what they've done?{03}Come on, we need to{03}make them fess up!{02}{00}
You don't stand a chance! We're{03}hardened criminal types! We eat{03}punks like you for breakfast!{02}{00}
Watch yourselves, you self-{03}righteous little brats! You're{03}the ones with a lesson to learn!{02}{00}
Well, that takes care of that!{02}{00}
And I'm willing to bet everyone{03}Briggs has been harassing{03}will be quite happy to hear it!{02}{00}
This should set everyone in{03}Indra at ease... They all seemed{03}to fear the pirate Briggs...{02}{00}
We lost...{02}{00}
Even pirates have honor...{03}I'll go quietly. I won't make a{03}scene just because I lost...{02}{00}
Go on... Hand us over to{03}Madra or Alhafra or whoever...{02}{00}
Good... First off, you can tell{03}the Madrans that the man called{03}{11}{08} is innocent.{02}{00}
Fine. So, what, I just have to{03}say that {11}{08} isn't{03}one of my men?{1E}{00}
That's right. You tell the{03}Madrans that, and they can{03}release their prisoner.{02}{00}
Saying {11}{08} is{03}innocent won't clear you{03}of your own crimes...{02}{00}
We've secured Briggs's{03}vow... We should take him{03}to the Madrans...{02}{00}
Wait!{02}{00}
Can't you find it in your{03}hearts to forgive Briggs{03}and his men?{02}{00}
And who are you?{02}{00}
My name is Chaucha.{03}I am Briggs's wife.{02}{00}
So you're a pirate, too?{02}{00}
No! Chaucha hasn't done{03}a thing! Let her be!{02}{00}
I know Briggs and his men{03}have caused some great{03}trouble with their piracy...{02}{00}
And I know their crimes{03}cannot be ignored...{02}{00}
If you know all that, then{03}how can you ask us just{03}to forgive him?{02}{00}
The only reason Briggs{03}became a pirate was to help{03}the people of Champa.{02}{00}
We Champa are a seafaring folk.{03}Our livelihood depends entirely{03}upon the sea.{02}{00}
But in recent years, the sea{03}has changed... We can't live{03}the life we once could.{02}{00}
The oceans have warmed, and{03}the fish have vanished from{03}our waters.{02}{00}
The soil in Champa is rocky{03}and barren. No crops can{03}grow there.{02}{00}
No crops? So you have no{03}grains? And no meat? It sounds{03}like life in Champa is hard...{02}{00}
It's not hard! It's unbearable!{03}Our children can't eat! Our{03}village is dying!{02}{00}
These men promised to return{03}with food enough for all our{03}people, but they found none...{02}{00}
So you became pirates...thieves...{02}{00}
We don't know where{03}Champa is...{02}{00}
It sits on the southeast{03}corner of Angara...{02}{00}
Southeast Angara? Isn't that{03}near Xian and Lama Temple?{02}{00}
You have a good memory! If{03}you were to head south through{03}the mountains, you'd find it.{02}{00}
That's so far away...{02}{00}
Well, yeah! You think we{03}could be successful pirates{03}so close to home?{02}{00}
If they raided any towns near{03}Champa, it would be obvious{03}to all who the attackers were...{02}{00}
And no one back home could{03}forgive me if they knew.{03}Not even my grandmother...{02}{00}
But where does that leave us?{03}Are we simply to accept your{03}looting here on Indra?{02}{00}
I'm shocked, I tell you. Shocked!{02}{00}
What's so shocking?{02}{00}
It looks like they really{03}are pirates, just like you{03}said...{02}{00}
Mister Mayor, I am appalled{03}that you could not take{03}our word for it!{02}{00}
He probably wouldn't even{03}have believed we were from{03}Madra if the mayor hadn't come!{02}{00}
Am I supposed to believe{03}the accusations of a{03}complete stranger?{02}{00}
Is this your position, Mayor?{02}{00}
How can I be expected to{03}believe a tidal wave could{03}wash Indra into Osenia?{02}{00}
Or that a group of men{03}could walk{B0}on foot!{B0}from{03}Madra all the way to Alhafra?{02}{00}
It sounds to me like you had{03}forgotten about us altogether!{02}{00}
I'm not sure you remember{03}the last time we met. Do you?{02}{00}
We met when I was just a child...{03}It must have been more than{03}ten years ago now...{02}{00}
Twenty years! It's been twenty{03}years since I last saw you.{02}{00}
Has it really been so long?{02}{00}
It's been a long time indeed!{02}{00}
I guess we can't blame you{03}for forgetting his face.{02}{00}
Don't be silly! I didn't forget{03}his face! His face merely...{03}changed!{02}{00}
Ahem! Forgive my interrupting{03}your interruption, but...{02}{00}
Would I be correct in assuming{03}that I am speaking to the leaders{03}of Madra and Alhafra?{02}{00}
You are correct!{03}I am the mayor of Madra.{02}{00}
And I...{00}
I am...{00}
I am the mayor of Alhafra.{02}{00}
I am Madra's town elder.{02}{00}
And I am a close personal{03}friend of Shin, whose lover{03}was injured by the Champa!{02}{00}
I am the scholar Kraden.{02}{00}
He is {11}{05}, the{03}leader of our group.{02}{00}
I am {11}{06}, {11}{05}'s{03}sister.{02}{00}
I am called {11}{07}.{03}I come from the town{03}of Lalivero.{02}{00}
Now, what errand has{03}brought you all here?{02}{00}
We came for Briggs...{00}
The mayor of Madra claims{B0}{00}
We followed Briggs here{03}from Madra.{02}{00}
Of course, we have good{03}reason to suspect them{03}of being pirates.{02}{00}
Ahem! And I was honestly{03}taken aback to hear a{03}businessman being slandered!{02}{00}
If they truly are pirates, then{03}why would they go to the trouble{03}of buying a ship from us?{02}{00}
Because the very funds they{03}used to purchase the ship{03}were pillaged from our homes!{02}{00}
If the ship was bought with{03}Madran gold, then it belongs{03}to the Madrans!{02}{00}
What do you say? If you give{03}them the ship, will that fix{03}everything?{02}{00}
Then where will you go?{02}{00}
I won't run, and I won't hide.{03}...Actually, I don't feel up for{03}much of anything right now.{02}{00}
Then you probably won't mind{03}being locked up, will you?{02}{00}
Briggs...{02}{00}
Don't worry, Chaucha!{03}I'll be back!{02}{00}
Take care of Eoleo!{02}{00}
Your strange powers surprised{03}me, but even without them, you{03}would have overwhelmed us.{02}{00}
We'll be taking that boat, then.{02}{00}
You're taking our ship!? You're{03}worse than we ever were!{02}{00}
Aren't you at least going{03}to pay us for the boat!?{02}{00}
Quiet! All of you!{02}{00}
Do as you must, but I{03}have one request...{02}{00}
You have to let Chaucha and{03}Eoleo stay in the boat{03}until it's repaired.{02}{00}
You haven't done Alhafra any{03}harm, Briggs...{02}{00}
At least keep him locked up{03}until the boat is repaired...{02}{00}
And our prisoner, {11}{08}...{03}Is he one of your men?{02}{00}
I don't know any {11}{08}!{03}Sounds to me like you've{03}made a pretty big mistake!{02}{00}
See! It's just as I said!{03}{11}{08} is innocent!{02}{00}
You must return to Madra{03}and free him immediately!{02}{00}
...Me? What, alone?!?{02}{00}
Only two of us will remain{03}here. You can return to{03}Madra with the others.{02}{00}
Understood! We'll return{03}immediately!{02}{00}
Can you come with us?{03}...Please?{02}{00}
It looks like that wraps{03}this whole mess up...{02}{00}
Let us return to my mansion{03}for a nice cup of tea...{02}{00}
You say your name{03}is Kraden?{02}{00}
Thank you very much for{03}the help with Briggs.{02}{00}
If you have the time, please{03}come see me at my mansion{03}before you go...{02}{00}
It's nothing special, but I{03}would like to thank you for{03}everything you've done.{02}{00}
Why do I get the feeling the{03}mayor of Alhafra prefers to{03}deal with my father over me?{02}{00}
Thank all of you{03}very much.{02}{00}
Due to your efforts,{03}{11}{08} is going{03}to be released.{02}{00}
And now, this fine ship{03}belongs to Madra.{02}{00}
None of this would have{03}come to pass were it not{03}for you. Thank you.{02}{00}
Unfortunately, I don't have any{03}reward I can offer you here...{02}{00}
Oh, pish posh! We don't need{03}any reward, do we,{03}{11}{05}?{1E}{00}
Ha! Your honesty is{03}refreshing, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
That's as may be, but I still{03}feel quite indebted to you.{02}{00}
So, what shall we do?{02}{00}
I know... Come to Madra{03}after our boat has been{03}fixed and we've sailed home.{02}{00}
We are still recovering from{03}the effects of the tidal wave,{03}so it won't be much...{01}But we do want to give{03}you some kind of reward.{02}{00}
Well, shall we be going?{02}{00}
I see, so...{02}{00}
Oh! N-Nothing. Never mind...{02}{00}
I do get to stay on the{03}boat, right? At least until{03}it's repaired?{02}{00}
Yes. That's where I'll be if{03}you need me. ...With Eoleo...{02}{00}
I feel kind of bad for Chaucha.{02}{00}
What can we do about it?{03}After all, she's the one{03}married to a pirate.{02}{00}
So, what should we do now?{02}{00}
I suggest that we try to{03}find {11}{08}. He could{03}prove enlightening!{02}{00}
That's true... He seems to{03}be a Water Adept.{01}He might be able to tell us{03}a little about these lands...{02}{00}
Do you think we should{03}help them fix the boat?{02}{00}
Say, if we help with the boat,{03}maybe they'll give us a ride{03}back to Madra! Good idea!{02}{00}
What do you say, {11}{05}?{1E}{00}
All right! Let's go see{03}what we can do to get{03}this thing sailing again!{02}{00}
You're opposed to it? Well,{03}since you seem to have your{03}own ideas, let's get going!{02}{00}
Goo goo ga ga!{02}{00}
Eoleo's only just recently{03}started doing that... After that{03}gem fell from the sky and hit him.{01}He was overcome by a{03}terrible fever, and when he{03}recovered, he had this power.{02}{00}
Eoleo and I are going to{03}visit Briggs every day.{02}{00}
I'm gonna use my magic{03}to free Papa.{02}{00}
If Eoleo gets the hang{03}of it, then maybe Briggs can...{02}{00}
We're all going to work together{03}to rebuild the homes that were{03}destroyed by the tidal wave.{01}It may have hurt us, but if{03}we put our backs into it, we{03}can overcome this hardship.{02}{00}
Once things are back to{03}normal, we're all going to{03}build another sailboat.{01}If we all work together,{03}we'll have it done in no time!{02}{00}
So, the guys who bought the{03}boat are the pirates who{03}were terrorizing Madra?{02}{00}
Everyone is talking about{03}how you captured the pirates{03}in the prison.{01}Wow! Taking care of that{03}salty bunch is something else!{02}{00}
The mayor is the only one from{03}Madra who stayed in town.{01}They said something about{03}freeing an innocent man...{02}{00}
The mayor of Madra apparently{03}seized the boat from the pirates{03}and plans to sail it back home.{01}I think he's got quite a{03}wait in store before that{03}mast gets fixed.{02}{00}
I never thought a fine house{03}could be crushed in the blink{03}of an eye by plain old water.{01}I guess that's what makes tidal{03}waves true natural disasters.{02}{00}
I can help build houses,{03}too. ...At least for a little{03}while, right?{02}{00}
We've put off fixing the boat{03}for now so we can work{03}on repairing the town first.{01}Which is exactly the{03}opposite of what the mayor{03}of Alhafra said would happen.{02}{00}
Once repairs are done here,{03}we have to fix the bridge in{03}the northwest of Osenia.{01}I guess Briggs destroyed it.{03}If you're going that way, I'd{03}wait until the bridge is fixed.{02}{00}
They told me they'd help{03}get that mast fixed up.{01}Would someone please explain{03}to me why suddenly they all{03}decided to fix houses instead?{02}{00}
What does a sailor like{03}me know about building{03}houses, anyway?{02}{00}
Hey! You there! Sailor boy!{03}Get back to work!{02}{00}
Hey! Give me a break!{03}I'm on it!{02}{00}
It's so nice of everyone{03}to chip in and help rebuild{03}Alhafra.{02}{00}
Everyone in town is so much{03}happier now that we've started{03}rebuilding the town...{01}I hope things stay this nice{03}once all the work is done.{02}{00}
You know, pirates who pay{03}for stuff instead of stealing{03}must be pretty weird pirates.{02}{00}
Those pirates have{03}the coolest outfits!{01}Someday, I wanna be a{03}pirate, so I can dress{03}up all fancy like that!{02}{00}
I can't believe they left{03}their mayor behind! Those{03}Madrans are so coldhearted.{02}{00}
If our mayor thinks I'm going{03}to work on a boat for him,{03}he's got another think coming.{01}Madra's mayor can wait{03}here forever for all I care.{02}{00}
You know, sitting here fixing{03}houses really makes you think{03}about how unsafe the sea is.{02}{00}
Helping people out feels{03}really good.{02}{00}
The fact that Madra took{03}our boat from us can't be{03}sitting well with the mayor.{01}That's probably why he{03}put off fixing their mast.{02}{00}
I wonder if the crew from{03}Madra went back through{03}Yampi Desert...{01}If they weren't in such a{03}rush, they could just wait{03}for the bridge to be fixed.{02}{00}
It's strange... The quarters{03}down in the belly of that{03}ship feel pretty cramped...{01}It seems like there should{03}be a lot more space down{03}there somewhere...{02}{00}
Working on deck with the{03}cool ocean breeze on your{03}face feels great.{01}Working on land doesn't.{02}{00}
I'm amazed those guys who{03}bought the ship were pirates...{01}But then again, they didn't{03}much look like your average,{03}run-of-the-mill merchants...{02}{00}
I thought it was weird that{03}someone would pay that{03}much for a broken ship...{01}They probably had some{03}secret plan to steal from us...{03}That's why they were so quiet!{02}{00}
Pirates? Here in Alhafra?{03}That's a scary thought. I'm{03}so glad they were caught!{02}{00}
Those guys were just trying{03}to win our trust so they could{03}take advantage of us!{02}{00}
We've all started working{03}together to repair the houses!{02}{00}
Oooh... Not much longer, and{03}then I can kick these folks{03}out of my house!{02}{00}
Once my old neighbors' house{03}is repaired, my life can finally{03}get back to normal.{02}{00}
Once everyone started working{03}to rebuild the town, our hostess{03}started being much nicer.{02}{00}
I wonder what happened{03}that's making the lady of the{03}house smile so much...{02}{00}
Ahh... It's so relieving to see{03}my wife smiling again.{01}I don't think there will be{03}any more arguments with{03}our elderly guests...{02}{00}
It won't be long until our{03}guests go back home...{01}It's a lot of work to help{03}a friend in need, but it does{03}feel good to be nice.{02}{00}
The lady of this house is so{03}temperamental. She gets angry{03}at the smallest things...{01}It was just a little tomato{03}juice. How was I to know{03}that was her wedding gown?{02}{00}
The lady of the house is{03}so adorable when she's{03}in a good mood.{01}It would be nice if she{03}were always in a good mood...{02}{00}
Once they fix the old folks'{03}home, it'll be our turn to get{03}some repairs done.{01}We're all doing our part{03}to get things fixed, even if{03}it's just a little cleaning up.{02}{00}
I was afraid my house{03}would never get repaired,{03}but everything's fine now.{01}With everyone working{03}together, maybe our new{03}houses will be a little sturdier.{02}{00}
I'm so hungry I can't{03}even move...{02}{00}
If we don't get out of{03}this inn soon, I'll die of{03}starvation!{01}The sooner Dad gets the{03}house fixed, the sooner I{03}get a good meal!{02}{00}
You know, since we're rebuilding{03}the house, maybe I'll ask for{03}my own room!{02}{00}
I wish someone would{03}just bring me some food...{02}{00}
Thanks, mister.{02}{00}
The kid ate the bread.{02}{00}
Oh, wow, I feel so much better!{03}Look at how much energy{03}I've got now!{02}{00}
Geez, mister, I don't know{03}how I can repay you...{02}{00}
Wait, I've got it! Do you{03}like...adventures?{1E}{00}
Then you totally have to go{03}check out the caves under{03}the mayor's mansion!{01}Go find my dad... He's up{03}along the path near there.{03}The entrance is just past him.{02}{00}
Really? Wow... You're so boring.{03}Well, if you change your{03}mind, just let me know.{02}{00}
I'm feeling a lot better now{03}thanks to you, mister.{01}If you get any more food,{03}could you bring it to me, too?{02}{00}
I wonder if I should have{03}shared some with my sister.{02}{00}
All my neighbors are going{03}to work together to help{03}rebuild my house.{01}A friend in need really{03}is a friend indeed!{02}{00}
Why, look at this!{02}{00}
Wow, honey! You found{03}some gold coins!{02}{00}
Way to go, Mom! So...{03}How much did you find?{02}{00}
Oh! Well, it's not too much...{03}It's only 5 coins.{02}{00}
That's great, though! We can{03}use it to buy some food!{02}{00}
I'm going to start looking, too!{02}{00}
What a stroke of luck! Right{03}when we really needed it, too!{01}There might be more, so{03}let's keep looking!{02}{00}
I wonder if there's any more{03}money hidden around here...{01}Oh, and I'll help with{03}the cleaning up, too!{02}{00}
My dad lost the draw, so{03}our house is going to be{03}the last one to get fixed...{02}{00}
Losing the lottery and being{03}the last house to get fixed{03}takes some pretty bad luck.{01}At least no one is{03}complaining about how{03}bad our luck is...except me...{02}{00}
I thought the hard part of{03}cleaning up would be fixing{03}the houses...{01}But that's a piece of cake{03}next to having to pick up{03}all these pots and jars...{02}{00}
I really shouldn't be peeking{03}into other people's pots,{03}should I?{02}{00}
All because of my dad's{03}stupid luck, our house is{03}the very last one fixed.{01}Maybe he can make up{03}for it by finding some cash.{02}{00}
What? Briggs was the{03}leader of a crew of pirates?{03}Aw, but he was so nice!{02}{00}
Briggs was very generous.{03}He bought plenty of weapons.{03}Wait a minute...{01}I wonder what he was{03}going to DO with all{03}those weapons...{02}{00}
That group from Madra{03}was incredibly lucky!{01}They didn't do a thing, but{03}they get a great boat because{03}someone else caught Briggs.{02}{00}
Getting a boat for nothing{03}seems like a pretty good{03}deal to me...{01}If you ignore the fact that{03}that boat isn't going{03}anywhere for a while.{02}{00}
The Madrans dropped in{03}and stocked up on items.{01}I guess they're traveling by{03}way of Yampi, or they wouldn't{03}have needed so many supplies.{02}{00}
The Madrans must have been{03}in quite a hurry...{01}They knew we were going{03}to fix the bridge pretty soon.{02}{00}
As soon as I'm done{03}fixing up the inn, I'm going{03}to give a hand in town.{02}{00}
We're all taking turns helping{03}out with the repairs in town.{01}The lady hasn't ever had to{03}work this hard before. I hope{03}she's going to be all right.{02}{00}
Everyone's working so hard{03}to restore this town to its{03}previous splendor!{01}I've been working all{03}day, and I'm beat.{02}{00}
There's still plenty of work{03}to do once all the construction{03}is finished...{01}It's going to be a long time{03}before these houses feel{03}livable again.{02}{00}
Tonight's meal is chock-full{03}of ingredients to restore{03}strength and vitality.{01}Manual labor requires a lot{03}of energy, so you have to{03}rejuvinate with a good meal!{02}{00}
Mom said we're gonna have{03}a bigger house than before.{03}I hope I get my own room.{02}{00}
My son has terrible luck...{03}I think I passed my bad-luck{03}genes on to him...{01}At the very least, I hope{03}my grandchildren end up{03}with better luck than we had.{02}{00}
The guy next to us is{03}awfully handsome. He's{03}just my type...{02}{00}
So, I hear you{03}caught Briggs...{1E}{00}
{11}{04}, a young girl{03}from my clan, was very kind,{03}much like you are...{01}Perhaps you should consider{03}lending a hand to the mayor{03}of Madra. He could use it...{02}{00}
You have no need to hide{03}such fine exploits from me.{01}Working hard for the benefit{03}of others is quite noble. That's{03}what {11}{04} always said...{02}{00}
Why do I have to work so{03}hard? I'm tired, and I'm in{03}terrible shape for my age.{02}{00}
I may not look very strong,{03}but I know I can help out.{03}I want to lend a hand.{02}{00}
We heard a loud popping{03}sound when we tried to{03}hoist the mast...{01}We thought we'd broken{03}the mast, but it turns out{03}it was just my spine...{02}{00}
I wonder what our new{03}houses will look like...{03}I can't wait to see them.{02}{00}
I was told to use only the{03}cheapest ingredients, but{03}I actually bought only the best.{01}I don't think I'll be{03}telling the master of{03}the inn about this.{02}{00}
Oh! If we get a bigger{03}house, we can get all{03}kinds of pets!{02}{00}
I guess I just don't have{03}any faith in myself...{01}I should go with my instincts,{03}but I always change my{03}mind at the last second.{02}{00}
Our neighbor is so mellow.{03}He never stresses out. Maybe{03}that's why he's so lucky.{02}{00}
Feel free to help whomever{03}you like if it truly makes{03}you happy.{01}Perhaps capturing Briggs{03}marks the beginning of your{03}dreams coming to fruition.{02}{00}
That cute boy next door{03}left already. What a shame.{02}{00}
The fellow next door was so{03}handsome. He was just my type.{03}This one's not so bad either!{02}{00}
Capturing the dreaded{03}Briggs was a great deed.{01}Allow me to thank you{03}on behalf of my townsfolk.{02}{00}
I think this man might{03}even be able to defeat{03}the horrible werewolves...{02}{00}
You here to see Briggs?{02}{00}
Chaucha... It's good to see you.{02}{00}
And you, too, Eoleo.{02}{00}
Goo. Goo goo ga.{02}{00}
How...is your cell? Is there{03}anything I can do to make{03}this easier on you?{02}{00}
I'm fine, Chaucha.{03}My only complaint is that{03}the food here is terrible.{02}{00}
What!? Are they forcing you{03}to eat this disgusting gruel?{02}{00}
Now, wait a second...{02}{00}
First of all, it's not disgusting.{03}It's nutritious! And besides...{02}{00}
You're IN JAIL! What did{03}you expect, gourmet cuisine?{02}{00}
Eoleo!{02}{00}
Eoleo!{02}{00}
Hooo...{02}{00}
Ahhh waaah...{02}{00}
{09}{02}WAHHH!{02}{00}
I don't know why he's crying!{03}You're his mother! Can't you{03}do something?!{02}{00}
There there, Eoleo...{03}What's the matter?{02}{00}
Waa waa waa!{02}{00}
Did the mean old guard{03}frighten you?{02}{00}
Waa waa...{02}{00}
Don't let him bother you...{03}He's just a big bully! Come{03}on! Let's get you home!{02}{00}
Waa waa...{02}{00}
We'll be back again later.{03}Will that be all right?{02}{00}
Yeah, yeah. That's fine.{02}{00}
We'll come back soon, dear.{02}{00}
WAHHH!{00}
I've been WAY too busy ever{03}since you captured Briggs{03}and his pirate crew.{02}{00}
Oh, stopped by for a{03}visit, did you?{1E}{00}
I wish that I'd met you under{03}different circumstances...{01}If we had met out on the{03}open seas, you would have{03}seen a different man.{02}{00}
Ah, so you just came here{03}to check up on us?{01}Hah! Well, as you can see,{03}we're not causing any trouble!{02}{00}
I hate prison. The food is terrible...{01}My bed is hard and lumpy...{03}It's even worse than being{03}a pirate was.{02}{00}
It sounds like the mayor of{03}Alhafra lost interest in fixing{03}that boat.{01}I guess that means it will{03}be a while before the mast{03}gets raised again.{02}{00}
Everything would have been{03}fine if it hadn't been for{03}you meddling kids!{02}{00}
I saw you staring at{03}Eoleo... But you couldn't{03}have figured out...{01}N-No! Of course not!{03}Nobody could see that.{02}{00}
It's so boring here when{03}there's no one to guard. I'm{03}glad I've got some company.{02}{00}
{11}{05} has strange{03}powers of his own, so we can't{03}let him see what Eoleo can do.{01}If he does, he might ruin our{03}only chance to escape...{02}{00}
I'm not staying in this stupid{03}cell forever. I'll get outta{03}here one way or another!{02}{00}
If they don't fix that{03}boat, then it's not going{03}anywhere.{01}I bet Alhafra's greedy mayor{03}doesn't like seeing Madra{03}profit from all of this.{02}{00}
Oh, what's that punk {11}{05}{03}doing again? I wish that{03}troublemaker'd just scram!{02}{00}
I hear some people can see{03}Eoleo's power... I want to see{03}for myself! How does he do it?{02}{00}
Ah! {11}{05}! Welcome,{03}welcome...{01}Listen, sorry about all that{03}"not letting you in" business{03}before... Don't take it personally.{02}{00}
Oh, {11}{05}! Go on in!{03}The mayor's been looking{03}forward to meeting with you.{02}{00}
If I'd known Briggs was{03}a pirate, I would have{03}fought him myself.{01}I never get to have any fun.{02}{00}
The mayor was really impressed{03}with these guys... He'll probably{03}want them to stay in Alhafra...{01}I hope he doesn't try to give{03}{11}{05} my job.{03}I hate when he does that.{02}{00}
No one is allowed beyond this point.{03}Don't even think about it.{02}{00}
The mayor said no one goes{03}through, and I mean to make{03}sure no one goes through!{02}{00}
You're the one who gave my{03}son some food, aren't you?{01}Did you want to go{03}see the cave?{1E}{00}
If you were up for a little{03}spelunking, I'd be glad to{03}let you pass. Oh well...{02}{00}
I'm only letting you pass{03}because you did good{03}by my son...{02}{00}
I'm only letting you by so{03}you can explore a little.{01}Make sure you don't{03}lay a hand on any of{03}the mayor's treasure.{02}{00}
I've heard that the deeper{03}you go into the cave, the more{03}dangerous it gets, so be wary.{02}{00}
Not that it matters. The door to{03}the mayor's treasure room is{03}locked, so they're not getting in.{02}{00}
You should go to the{03}watchtower and gaze{03}southward.{01}On a clear day you can see{03}the most amazing view of{03}Air's Rock from there.{02}{00}
What do you think of Alhafra?{03}Have you taken a fancy to it?{1E}{00}
Then you are welcome to{03}stay here and relax for{03}as long as you please.{01}I am sure our mayor will{03}be happy to hear it.{02}{00}
Then why don't you follow{03}your feet to the south?{01}There are plenty of delights{03}for warriors such as you in{03}the middle of Osenia.{02}{00}
Our town was rife with{03}pirates until just recently.{01}Your efforts have removed{03}a scourge from our town. We{03}truly owe you our gratitude.{02}{00}
The mountains to the east{03}of Alhafra are the Balloo{03}Range. They divide Osenia in two.{01}And we call the area on the{03}other side of the Balloo Range{03}East Osenia.{02}{00}
There are numerous tales{03}about that rocky peak we{03}call Air's Rock.{01}Air's Rock looks so odd that{03}many people think there must{03}be something in hiding there.{02}{00}
Why do they always tell me{03}to send adventure-seekers{03}to South Osenia?{01}All you do is go to the{03}desert and head south. Where's{03}the adventure in that?{02}{00}
Those pirates never did us{03}any harm, but that's because{03}they were up to something.{02}{00}
There's no way to cross the{03}Balloo Range from here.{01}I've heard western Osenia{03}is nothing compared to the{01}frightful things found{03}in the east.{02}{00}
Lookee here!{03}Can't you see Air's{03}Rock out there?{1E}{00}
From here, it just looks like{03}a regular old rock, but from{03}up close, it's something else!{01}The first thing you think{03}when you see it is "Now{03}that's one serious rock!"{02}{00}
Oh... I guess today is a bit{03}cloudier than usual.{01}Air's Rock has another name.{03}They call it the Windy Peak. You{03}almost never see clouds near it.{02}{00}
The longer I sit here gazing{03}at Air's Rock, the more I grow{03}to love it.{01}All it takes is one glance,{03}and you're convinced it holds{03}some mystery deep within.{02}{00}
I'd been saying Indra wasn't{03}in the right place for some{03}time now.{01}Nobody would believe me{03}until the mayor of Madra{03}actually walked here!{02}{00}
I sat and gazed at that{03}continent every day.{01}I ought to know where that{03}continent should and{03}shouldn't be, I tell you!{02}{00}
Are you the brave hero{03}who defeated the pirates?{1E}{00}
Well, I wonder if even{03}a hero like you can stand{03}up against a creature...{01}With the brains of man{03}and the strength and{03}cunning of a beast.{01}If you don't think any such{03}creatures exist, then head{03}south and see for yourself.{02}{00}
I know you're the one who{03}beat the pirates... Don't try{03}to act humble...{01}You should have a little{03}more faith in your deeds.{02}{00}
I heard the pirates talking{03}about the warriors who beat{03}them. They sounded tough.{02}{00}
I wish someone would go do{03}something about that cursed{03}village south of us. It's evil...{02}{00}
I hope the warriors who{03}defeated the pirates aren't{03}from Garoh, the cursed village.{02}{00}
Darn that mayor...{02}{00}
I thought he'd get that mast{03}fixed up for us right away...{02}{00}
I'm starting to think the mayor{03}of Alhafra never planned on{03}repairing that boat at all!{01}I was a fool to believe{03}he would help us...{02}{00}
He's already been paid to fix{03}the boat, but he says that was{03}only while it was Briggs's.{01}He probably expects us to{03}pay for the repairs a second{03}time... The greedy pig...{02}{00}
If we leave the boat here and{03}go home, the mayor of Alhafra{03}keeps the boat AND the money.{01}There must be a way to fix{03}that boat without relying on{03}Alhafra's help...{02}{00}
The money Briggs used to{03}pay for that boat was stolen{03}from our people...{01}I don't think it's wrong for us{03}to expect the mayor of Alhafra{03}to honor his promise.{02}{00}
I'm sure the mayor has his{03}reasons for halting repairs{03}on the sailboat...{02}{00}
The mayor feels that Madra{03}should only get back what was{03}stolen from them. Nothing more...{02}{00}
But now, it seems the Madrans{03}are getting the better end of{03}the deal...{02}{00}
The mayor thinks it unfair{03}that Madra should benefit{03}while Alhafra suffers.{02}{00}
That's why he's keeping the{03}pirates' money and using it{03}to repair Alhafra, not the boat.{02}{00}
If Madra wants their boat{03}fixed, then they can just{03}pay us to have it fixed.{02}{00}
Briggs tells me there are{03}huge towns on a continent{03}that lies across the Eastern Sea.{02}{00}
He tells me that, by trading{03}with one another, all of these{03}towns prosper and grow...{02}{00}
I've made a decision... If Alhafra{03}is to prosper, then we must{03}trade, too! Trade and grow!{02}{00}
I'm going to build an entire{03}trade fleet and make lots{03}of money!{02}{00}
Still...there must be other{03}pirates and freebooters{03}still roaming the high seas.{02}{00}
{11}{05}, Briggs told{03}me you and your friends{03}fought with great strength.{02}{00}
If you could lend me that{03}strength, we would need{03}not fear any pirates.{02}{00}
So if you'd just be willing{03}to help us out, our town could{03}begin trading...and prospering...{02}{00}
What do you say?{03}Do we have a deal?{1E}{00}
Great! Why don't you just{03}stay here in Alhafra until we're{03}ready for our first trade run?{02}{00}
Ah, such a pity that you{03}don't see the potential of{03}this partnership...{01}I certainly hope you will{03}reconsider... We stand to{03}make a lot of money...{02}{00}
I am planning a glorious new{03}sailing ship so that we can{03}begin trading immediately...{01}I'm certain this will go well,{03}and we will both become{03}very, very wealthy indeed.{02}{00}
The mayor won't help fix the{03}boat until he feels he's getting{03}a fair payment in exchange.{01}If Madra's mayor wants the{03}boat fixed, he's going to have{03}to shell out more cash.{02}{00}
This is such a fantastic{03}idea, and I'm the one who{03}thought of it...{01}So, naturally, it need only be{03}me alone who profits from it.{02}{00}
The mayor hates seeing anyone{03}else make money, so I'm sure{03}he'll make this tough on Madra.{01}Heh heh heh... The mayor{03}doesn't play fair.{02}{00}
You do plan to help with{03}the mast, right?{02}{00}
Not even Briggs and his{03}pirates could fix that mast.{03}How are we supposed to?{02}{00}
They need our help... We{03}at least have to try...{02}{00}
Isn't that right, {11}{05}?{02}{00}
Well then, we'd better get{03}right to it, hadn't we?{02}{00}
Are you finished here,{03}{11}{05}?{1E}{00}
Wait, you wanted to do this,{03}and now you're telling me{03}we should just give up?{02}{00}
I just don't see how{03}much more help we{03}can be here, {11}{07}.{02}{00}
Oh, don't be ridiculous! We've{03}already done so much.{02}{00}
I know how you feel, but{03}there's nothing else we{03}can do right now.{02}{00}
So... Maybe we should{03}start searching for{03}another ship then...{02}{00}
...Not that I was planning on{03}"borrowing" the Madran's ship!{02}{00}
Although...I did plan on asking{03}them if we could use it once{03}we got back to Madra...{02}{00}
But it doesn't look like{03}the ship will be leaving{03}anytime soon.{02}{00}
So I think maybe we should{03}just forget about that and start{03}on our way again, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
It looks like the mayor of{03}Madra went home to fetch{03}some workers for the boat...{02}{00}
I guess our mayor didn't even{03}offer Madra any help at all...{03}What a crummy thing to do.{02}{00}
I hear the mayor of Madra{03}went back through the desert{03}and home to Madra...{02}{00}
He seems like an honest,{03}hardworking young man...{03}nothing at all like our mayor.{02}{00}
I don't know what we're{03}going to do about this{03}rock...{01}I think we've done all we can{03}do here... Let's get going...{02}{00}
Hey! You lot! Hold{03}it right there!{02}{00}
Hang on, there's no need to{03}stop them. They couldn't be{03}involved in this mess...{02}{00}
If you're talking about the pirate{03}incident, I believe we resolved{03}that to everyone's satisfaction.{02}{00}
This has nothing to do with the{03}Champa this time, old man! This{03}time, the Kibombo attacked us!{02}{00}
"Old man"?!? Hmph!{02}{00}
Wait... Did you say you were{03}attacked again? By the Kibombo?{02}{00}
Do you know about{03}the Kibombo?{1E}{00}
You must be pretty worldly,{03}considering that they rarely{03}leave the heart of Gondowan.{02}{00}
Not many people do... They're{03}a barbaric tribe from central{03}Gondowan! Watch out for them!{02}{00}
When did all this happen?!{02}{00}
Not too long ago...{02}{00}
Right after the mayor{03}left, actually...{02}{00}
It was them, wasn't{03}it, {11}{05}?{1E}{00}
Of course! They did seem to be{03}acting awfully strange when we{03}saw them in that cave...{02}{00}
Surely you remember, {11}{05}!{03}The cave? Those strange men{03}we saw in there?{02}{00}
Was anything stolen?{02}{00}
Only a single black orb...{03}Everything else was untouched.{02}{00}
A black orb...{02}{00}
I'm afraid we don't have much{03}more information than that.{02}{00}
You helped us with the Champa,{03}so, I'll tell you what...{01}Maybe you could look around{03}at the mayor's house. It's the{03}only one that was robbed.{02}{00}
First, pirates raid our town,{03}then the Kibombo come{03}storming in...{01}Things have been going{03}horribly for Madra lately...{02}{00}
My guess is the Kibombo{03}have long since fled the{03}area.{01}Still, considering the way things{03}have been going, we still want{03}to have guards at the gates.{02}{00}
The way things have been{03}going, I'm so scared I can{03}hardly sleep at night...{01}Is there no way to appease{03}the gods? Is our town cursed?{02}{00}
I've been standing for so{03}long, I wish they would give us{03}little stools we could sit on.{02}{00}
Oh, uh... You coming through?{1E}{00}
Yeah, uh... We're sealing the{03}hole up right now, so you, uh,{03}can't get through this way.{01}If you're trying to get into{03}Madra, why don't you head{03}around to the main entrance?{02}{00}
Yeah, well, that's good, 'cause{03}we wouldn't let you down here{03}anyway...{01}Besides, anyone who's going{03}to Madra can just go through{03}the main gates, like normal folk.{02}{00}
We sealed up the hole, but{03}nobody seems to feel any{03}better...{01}Maybe we should just fill up{03}the catacombs completely...{02}{00}
We think the Kibombo came{03}into Indra across the new{03}land bridge...{01}But just because they {09}{02}could{07}{03}attack Madra doesn't mean{03}they had to...{02}{00}
So... The Kibombo got into{03}Madra from Gondowan, right?{01}Well, doesn't that mean that{03}we can cross into Gondowan{03}from Madra, too?{02}{00}
The Kibombo came in through{03}the broken wall to the west.{02}{00}
I heard that the elder got{03}us a boat in Alhafra...{03}I wonder if that's true...{02}{00}
I guess that guy we had{03}in prison wasn't one of{03}Briggs's cronies after all...{02}{00}
Gondowan sounds like a{03}frightening place. I don't{03}think I'll ever go there.{02}{00}
Hey, mister! Are you the guy{03}who beat up Briggs?{1E}{00}
So does that mean you'll{03}go thump the Kibombo, too?{02}{00}
You're not? Someone told{03}me it was a young warrior...{03}That sounded a bit like you.{02}{00}
I can't believe someone{03}stomped on those pirates...{03}That's incredible!{02}{00}
Now that we're sealing off the{03}other end of this hole, maybe we{03}won't have any more surprises!{02}{00}
There are still plenty of{03}things I want to investigate{03}in this cave.{01}And until I do, there's no way I'm{03}going to seal the entire thing off.{02}{00}
Briggs didn't have nearly{03}as many pirates under him{03}as we thought he did.{01}He did an amazing job of{03}flanking the town, considering{03}how few men he had.{02}{00}
These caves were my{03}secret hiding place.{01}I wish they weren't going{03}to seal it all up.{02}{00}
That guy {11}{08} wasn't{03}one of Briggs's men{03}after all.{01}I can't believe we locked him{03}up without any evidence...{02}{00}
Oh, {11}{08}? We released{03}him as soon as we heard.{01}He stopped by the mayor's{03}house and then left town.{02}{00}
Everyone yelled at me for{03}running away this last time,{03}so next time, I'm gonna fight!{01}But the thing is, last time,{03}I took such a beating I got{03}lumps on my head. Ouch!{02}{00}
You shoulda seen my partner{03}in that fight!{01}He was in the mix right up{03}until they took him down...{03}Man... That takes courage!{02}{00}
If it weren't for that tidal{03}wave, none of this awful stuff{03}would have happened...{02}{00}
If Gondowan is really that{03}much bigger than Indra,{03}then I should go check it out.{02}{00}
It's strange... It's almost as{03}though the Kibombo knew that{03}the wall was broken...{01}But there's no way they{03}could have known...unless{03}the pirates told them...{02}{00}
The mayor is supposed to be{03}coming back with that boat...{03}I wonder when that will be...{02}{00}
He told us he was innocent,{03}but we jailed him anyway. Is{03}that justice? Is that right?{02}{00}
In Gondowan, they have{03}evil magic curses they can{03}put on you in an instant!{02}{00}
I heard the guys who captured{03}Briggs were just a bunch of{03}feeble-looking kids...{02}{00}
If they were strong enough{03}to beat Briggs, they must{03}be huge!{02}{00}
It was so convenient, being{03}able to sneak out through{03}the cave to the other side.{02}{00}
I wonder who dug those{03}underground passages{03}and why they're there...{02}{00}
Wait, if Briggs only has four{03}crew members, then they{03}couldn't have outflanked us...{01}They must have had help{03}from someone else...{02}{00}
I've never seen any{03}monsters around the{03}cave entrance...{01}I want to go inside and see{03}if there are any monsters{03}inside, but I can't...{02}{00}
{11}{08} didn't seem like{03}he was in a very good{03}mood when he left town.{01}I guess he was still angry about{03}having been imprisoned like that.{02}{00}
{11}{08} was so happy{03}to get out of jail...{01}But after he spoke to the{03}mayor's wife, he looked unhappy.{03}I wonder what she told him.{02}{00}
I didn't have a chance to{03}run away during the fight. The{03}Kibombo were everywhere!{01}That's the only reason I stayed{03}to fight them. But I'm not about{03}to tell anyone that!{02}{00}
I can't believe nobody seems{03}impressed that my partner{03}fought the Kibombo so bravely.{01}Don't tell me they don't think{03}it takes guts to stand up{03}against them, because it does!{02}{00}
So Briggs and his pirates{03}must have gone to Alhafra{03}looking for a boat.{01}I'm impressed that they{03}were captured before{03}they could escape.{02}{00}
It was sure sneaky of Briggs{03}to destroy the bridge to{03}Osenia after they crossed.{01}It made it really hard for{03}the mayor to reach Alhafra.{02}{00}
Now that Briggs has{03}been captured, I have{03}nothing to fear!{01}Yes! That means I can head{03}to Osenia for some business!{02}{00}
It sounds like Osenia is a{03}huge place. They took forever{03}to catch up with Briggs!{02}{00}
The Kibombo are a very{03}warlike tribe.{01}That last attack was enough{03}to warn me to stay away{03}from central Gondowan!{02}{00}
I'm glad the Kibombo's attack{03}wasn't too terrible this time,{03}but what if they come back?{02}{00}
Our best guess is that the{03}Kibombo come from the{03}central part of Gondowan...{01}Why would they turn around{03}so quickly after coming all{03}this way?{02}{00}
What can we do to stop the{03}Kibombo from attacking us{03}again?{01}Maybe we have to find a way{03}to separate our continents,{03}like before the tidal wave...{02}{00}
The Kibombo apparently used{03}ropes to climb down the cliffs.{01}But we can't climb back up{03}the cliffs from this side.{02}{00}
My husband pursued the{03}Kibombo after the attack,{03}but he had to turn back...{02}{00}
If I were just a little bit younger,{03}I think I might have been able{03}to catch those Kibombo.{02}{00}
In his youth, my husband was{03}a very fast runner. They called{03}him "The Cheetah."{01}I guess he's learned that he{03}can't race against old age.{02}{00}
{11}{08} left that boat{03}of his behind when he took off...{01}That thing wasn't going{03}anywhere, so I guess he had{03}no choice but to give up.{02}{00}
I can't stop thinking about{03}that ship {11}{08} left{03}by the eastern shore.{02}{00}
Some people in town saw{03}{11}{08} heading toward{03}the Gondowan cliffs.{02}{00}
I wonder if that ship grounded{03}by the eastern shore is still{03}broken.{01}It seems like a well-built{03}ship. It'd be a shame to{03}just leave it there...{02}{00}
All the Kibombo wanted when{03}they attacked was the black orb{03}that sat above the fireplace.{01}We're just lucky{03}no one was hurt.{02}{00}
My father was holding on to{03}that orb for {11}{08}, and{03}the Kibombo stole it...{01}No matter how much he{03}apologizes for losing it,{03}it won't make things right.{02}{00}
{11}{08} went to Kibombo{03}to get his orb back.{01}We told him that central{03}Gondowan is very dangerous,{03}but he wouldn't listen.{02}{00}
If my father'd been in town,{03}I wouldn't have been scared{03}when the Kibombo attacked.{02}{00}
My father hasn't come home yet,{03}even though Briggs has{03}been captured.{01}I'm scared that something{03}happened to him...{02}{00}
When my husband hears that{03}the orb he was keeping was{03}stolen, he'll be quite angry...{02}{00}
I won't ever forget the look{03}on {11}{08}'s face when he{03}heard his orb was stolen.{01}He was so sad... It was like{03}he'd lost a part of himself...{02}{00}
When {11}{08} left, he said{03}he was going to pursue the{03}Kibombo, but I wonder...{01}What if he reached the cliffs{03}and then couldn't climb them.{03}I hope he's not stuck...{02}{00}
Dad always knows what to{03}do... He'd never have let those{03}Kibombo barge in here...{02}{00}
I hope he's just late because{03}he's looking for a good{03}souvenir to bring me...{02}{00}
{11}{08} wasn't one of{03}the Champa... That's{03}why they let him go.{01}You shouldn't just keep an{03}innocent man in prison for{03}no reason.{02}{00}
So, that {11}{08} guy{03}wasn't a pirate after all, huh?{01}That still doesn't answer{03}where that ice came from...{03}That freaked me out...{02}{00}
There was something really{03}frightening about {11}{08}...{03}I'm glad to be rid of him...{01}He went after the Kibombo,{03}but I doubt he'll make it{03}back from Gondowan alive.{02}{00}
That {11}{08} was a{03}strange fellow.{01}Shin was terrified of him.{03}He let him go as soon as we{03}learned he was innocent.{02}{00}
The armorer and I are busy{03}researching the equipment{03}the Kibombo left behind.{01}They dropped a lot of strange{03}weapons that might reveal{03}more about the attacks...{02}{00}
The Champa weapons we found{03}before are identical to the{03}Kibombo weapons we just found.{01}It can't be a coincidence...{02}{00}
I knew there was something{03}strange about the pirates{03}attacking us like that...{01}I think those weapons we{03}found are going to be the{03}key to the mystery...{02}{00}
The group that attacked from{03}the east used different weapons{03}from the group to the west.{01}If they really were from the{03}same crew, then why would{03}they use different weapons?{02}{00}
All my injuries have healed{03}up pretty nicely...{01}It made for a nice vacation,{03}but now, it's time to get back{03}to work.{02}{00}
I'm so happy that my sister's{03}all better now.{02}{00}
That Shin is always bugging{03}me just to relax and take{03}a break. He's a real pain.{01}I like working more than{03}I like sleeping.{02}{00}
I was so scared that my{03}sister wouldn't get better...{03}What would I do without her?{02}{00}
The Kibombo are a tribe from{03}Gondowan... They're searching{03}for some great and evil power.{01}Do not allow yourselves to{03}be corrupted by them.{02}{00}
If that tidal wave hadn't hit{03}us, the Kibombo would never{03}have been able to attack.{02}{00}
Them Kibombo possess{03}{09}{04}evil powers.{07} They sure{03}are a weird bunch.{02}{00}
I hope the power of our faith{03}will prevent the Kibombo{03}from attacking us again...{02}{00}
Everyone says them Kibombo{03}were mostly nekkid...{03}They sound so...savage!{02}{00}
We're lucky the Kibombo didn't{03}use their evil powers... There{03}were enough injuries as it was.{02}{00}
I've heard that the Kibombo{03}wield an evil, wicked magic...{01}But...why didn't they use any{03}of it when they attacked us?{02}{00}
Things have been busy here...{03}First, the pirates, then the{03}Kibombo... What a week!{02}{00}
I hid under my bed on{03}the night of the attack.{03}I was really scared!{02}{00}
I watched the entire attack of{03}the Kibombo with my own eyes.{01}I'll never forget it... I was{03}paralyzed with fear...{02}{00}
If you want to know about{03}the attack, talk to my partner.{03}He saw the whole thing.{02}{00}
There's nothing worse than{03}wicked, evil magic. I don't want{03}to see it, much less use it.{02}{00}
If it were me, I would have{03}attacked a wealthier town.{03}...If it were me.{02}{00}
After I crawled under the{03}bed, I fell asleep, so I was{03}pretty achy the next morning.{02}{00}
I had to go to the bathroom in{03}the middle of the night, but{03}when I went...{01}I saw all these eyes in the{03}darkness. I got so scared...{03}I didn't have to go anymore.{02}{00}
The Kibombo attacked in the{03}wee hours of the morning...{01}Why weren't they asleep, like{03}all us respectable people?{02}{00}
Is the way clear?{02}{00}
This area is clear! The strange{03}one has not been seen!{02}{00}
And there?{02}{00}
We have not seen the{03}stranger near the village.{02}{00}
Do you believe he was truly{03}headed toward Kibombo?{02}{00}
The guards here were only{03}recently knocked unconscious.{02}{00}
Correct. We were under orders{03}to maintain a strict watch{03}over the mountain pass.{02}{00}
No one must be permitted into{03}Kibombo until Akafubu has{03}completed his ceremony.{02}{00}
Then we had better hurry to{03}find the one who attacked{03}our guards.{02}{00}
Keep a good watch. Do not{03}permit anyone to pass.{02}{00}
If anyone interrupts Akafubu's{03}ceremony, he will hold you{03}responsible...{02}{00}
Guards! An intruder!{02}{00}
Someone is trying to{03}pass! To arms, Kibombo{03}warriors! To arms!{02}{00}
Here! The intruder is here!{02}{00}
Kibombo does not{03}permit visitors!{02}{00}
You just follow this road right{03}back to where you came from!{02}{00}
Guard! Get him out of here!{02}{00}
{09}{04}Grrrrr...{07} Rrrruff!!!{02}{00}
Ah-roooo! Ah-roooo!{03}HAWOOOO!!!!{02}{00}
Outsiders are not allowed{03}to enter Kibombo. Begone!{02}{00}
Grrrrr!{03}Rrrruff! Rrufff!{02}{00}
An intruder! Repel the intruder{03}immediately!{02}{00}
Hey! Who's there!? Get{03}me out of this crate!{02}{00}
Sniff sniff...{03}Lick lick lick!!{02}{00}
It's dark! It's cramped!{03}Somebody get me out!{02}{00}
A bone! That's my favruff!{03}Lick lick... It's deruffcious!{02}{00}
This rock is in my way.{03}I want to get to the other side.{02}{00}
Rrruff! Rrruff!{02}{00}
Dig here, you dig? Rrruff!{02}{00}
I knew it! I knew there was{03}something there, and he{03}dug it up! Look at that!{02}{00}
I tried to go to Gondowan to{03}find my fellow tribesmen, but{03}the ropes were taken down.{01}I can't go back to Kibombo{03}until someone realizes that{03}I'm missing and comes for me.{02}{00}
I wonder who removed the{03}rope from the other side...{02}{00}
If the other warriors knew we{03}could not return to Kibombo,{03}they would be distraught.{02}{00}
I long to see my homeland{03}again. This Indra lacks the{03}savage beauty of Gondowan.{02}{00}
{11}{05}! Where do you{03}intend to go?{01}We should try to help{03}{11}{08} recover his{03}black orb.{02}{00}
Kraden's right. I think we should{03}try to help {11}{08}, too.{02}{00}
I completely agree{03}with Kraden and {11}{06}.{02}{00}
It looks like the majority wins!{03}Let's go back to Kibombo{03}and help {11}{08}!{02}{00}
Welcome to Naribwe.{03}It's really hot out...{03}You should relax a while.{02}{00}
The Kibombo went on an{03}expedition to the east, but{03}they've already returned.{01}Do you know what kind of{03}expedition it was?{1E}{00}
What? They crossed over to{03}Indra and attacked a town!?{01}The Kibombo are a reckless{03}and dangerous people.{02}{00}
Oh, you don't? The Kibombo{03}rarely journey far abroad.{03}It's very worrisome...{02}{00}
The Kibombo never move in{03}such large numbers without{03}orders from Akafubu...{01}Without that witch doctor,{03}the Kibombo would be a{03}much more peaceful tribe...{02}{00}
I would not venture far north{03}of here if I were you...{02}{00}
It's been dangerous out ever{03}since the day the gems fell{03}from the sky.{01}After that day, all local{03}creatures suddenly grew{03}more powerful and terrifying.{02}{00}
When Oeia was their witch{03}doctor, the Kibombo were much{03}more peaceful.{01}Akafubu took over when Oeia{03}passed on, and he is responsible{03}for their warlike ways.{02}{00}
Can you tell me where you{03}have come from?{1E}{00}
Angara? That is a land far to{03}the north, is it not?{01}I've heard that when it is hot{03}here, it is cold in Angara.{03}The world is a strange place.{02}{00}
Why won't you tell me?{03}What are you trying to hide?{02}{00}
It's always hot here in Naribwe.{03}It doesn't matter if it's summer,{03}winter, or spring. It's always hot.{02}{00}
You don't plan on going to{03}Kibombo, do you, mister?{1E}{00}
Well, you'll have to find a path{03}through the Kibombo Mountains{03}to get there.{01}The Kibombo warriors keep{03}a close watch on the pass.{03}They won't let you through.{02}{00}
That's a wise choice. Nothing{03}good would come to you in{03}a place like that.{02}{00}
On the far side of the river{03}lies a huge mountain we call{03}Magma Rock.{01}It is a sacred place that{03}the gods created long ago.{02}{00}
I can hardly stand the heat{03}in Naribwe, and I've lived here{03}my whole life!{01}I can't imagine what travelers{03}must think of it.{02}{00}
Akafubu is almost certainly{03}looking for jewels.{01}I cannot understand{03}why a witch doctor{03}needs so many jewels.{02}{00}
It is awful to the north of{03}Naribwe... It is hotter, and{03}the creatures are fierce...{01}And worst of all, that's{03}where the Kibombo are!{02}{00}
That was the day the wind{03}blew so hard and the dark{03}clouds came from the north.{01}That's when those strange{03}gems fell from above.{02}{00}
Kibombo magic was once{03}widely respected. Now, it{03}is merely feared.{01}That is the way of things{03}since Oeia appointed Akafubu{03}as his successor before dying.{02}{00}
The warrior who passed through{03}here earlier said he came from{03}an isle in the middle of the sea.{02}{00}
To get to Kibombo, you have{03}to cross over the Kibombo{03}Mountains.{01}I seem to recall my{03}grandfather telling me about{03}a way past the guards.{02}{00}
Sometimes, you can hear{03}explosions from across the{03}river near Magma Rock.{01}I wonder what's going on{03}over there.{02}{00}
When I climbed the Kibombo{03}Mountains, I had to find a path{03}the Kibombo didn't know about...{02}{00}
I remember when I found that{03}path above the pass... Not even{03}the Kibombo knew about it!{01}I'm not even sure I could{03}find the way to the higher{03}pass anymore...{02}{00}
The fortune-teller lives{03}at the highest house in{03}Naribwe...{01}He's the closest thing{03}we have to a mayor.{02}{00}
We're a small village, but if{03}we all cooperate, we can get{03}almost anything done.{02}{00}
The fortune-teller in Naribwe{03}has quite a reputation...{03}His predictions are so accurate!{01}He's always done them for us{03}alone, so I don't understand{03}how he got so famous.{02}{00}
As long as we listen to the{03}words of the fortune-teller,{03}we won't have any worries...{02}{00}
If you desire a reading,{03}stand before the table...{02}{00}
{11}{05} placed {14}{02}{03}on the table.{02}{00}
I am a teller of fortunes.{03}Would you have a reading?{1E}{00}
Then stand back.{02}{00}
It costs 20 coins to hear{03}what your future holds.{03}Will you pay?{1E}{00}
Then away with you.{02}{00}
Many want things they cannot{03}afford. If you do not have the{03}money, you will have no reading.{02}{00}
Very well. Show me one{03}of your items.{02}{00}
Are you prepared?{1E}{00}
{11}{05} changed his mind{03}and took back the item.{02}{00}
Shall I give you another{03}reading for a different item?{1E}{00}
Then away with you.{02}{00}
I shall begin my reading...{02}{00}
I see...{02}{00}
Beyond the weapon you set{03}down lies a terrible foe.{02}{00}
Many enemies await you, far{03}beyond the mountains.{01}If you move to strike{03}them... you will meet{03}with great disaster.{02}{00}
In a misty sea, a mighty foe...{03}A fiersome battle awaits you.{01}Gather the pieces of the{03}weapon to defeat him, or{03}drown in defeat yourself.{02}{00}
None in the eastern world{03}can stand against the power{03}you possess.{02}{00}
I feel a shining power glowing{03}beyond the item before me.{02}{00}
You are lost in your way...{03}Another continent needs{03}your attention, another land.{01}A towering rock amid a{03}sea of sand. Return there{03}and find your way again.{02}{00}
A distant isle lies far to{03}the northeast... Sail there.{01}High atop a rocky peak, a{03}power awaits you...{02}{00}
I see a paradise awaiting{03}you... An island in the east.{01}But even paradise must have{03}its trials... Scale the peak and{03}earn your power.{02}{00}
A tiny figure stands against{03}a wasteland wrought in snow...{03}The southern edge of the world.{01}It is you... In the icy plains,{03}you will find ancient ruins{03}and ancient power.{02}{00}
I see you lost in mists, lost{03}in time, lost in the seas...{01}And there, I see you gaining{03}an ancient, fearsome power.{02}{00}
The eastern lands hold{03}little for you now. You will{03}not remain here long...{01}I see you opening a channel{03}between the continents and{03}sailing the Western Sea!{02}{00}
Beyond the item before me,{03}I see a path for you to follow.{02}{00}
I see you inside a sacred icon.{03}By listening to the voices,{03}you will earn a precious item.{02}{00}
You must forge a weapon to{03}defeat a mortal enemy.{03}Seek out the pieces!{02}{00}
You will raise a mighty column{03}and gain assistance where it{03}is least expected.{02}{00}
You will gain tremendous help{03}from a village on the eastern{03}reaches of the northern lands.{01}Seek them out.{02}{00}
You have the weapon you{03}need to defeat the sea beast.{01}Go to the sea of mists{03}and face your foe!{02}{00}
The object that you seek lies{03}somewhere in the west.{01}Why do you linger in the{03}eastern world? If your work is{03}done, the west beckons you.{02}{00}
The object you have placed{03}before me wields a mighty{03}power over a terrible foe.{02}{00}
Near the beach where you{03}washed ashore lie ancient{03}ruins. Seek them out.{02}{00}
In the northern reaches of{03}the Eastern Sea lie moss-{03}covered, overgrown ruins.{01}You should explore them.{02}{00}
In the distant south lies an icy{03}cape. Above the rocky shore{03}stands a tower. Climb it.{02}{00}
You have the weapon you{03}need in many fragments..{01}Bring them to the people at{03}the eastern edge of the{03}northern continent.{02}{00}
That object you have placed{03}before me... It is a fearsome{03}weapon to a particular beast.{02}{00}
If you wield this weapon, you{03}can defeat the legendary beast!{02}{00}
But there are no more beasts{03}for you to fear in this part{03}of the world.{02}{00}
From the garb you have{03}placed before me, I sense the{03}presence of the one you await.{02}{00}
To the east lies a continent{03}moved from its foundation. The{03}one you seek waits in the wood.{02}{00}
To the north...inside the sacred{03}icon, the one you seek awaits.{02}{00}
To the north...beneath the{03}sacred icon...the one you{03}seek awaits.{02}{00}
Head east by southeast... In a{03}cave on the southernmost{03}continent in the Eastern Sea...{01}The one you seek awaits.{02}{00}
Head east by northeast... In a{03}cave on a tiny islet, the{03}one you seek awaits.{02}{00}
Head north by northwest... In a{03}forest on the northernmost{03}continent in the Western Sea...{01}The one you seek awaits.{02}{00}
To the northwest...in the ruins{03}on the southern continent{03}in the Western Sea...{01}The one you seek awaits.{02}{00}
Head west by northwest... In an{03}inlet on the southern continent{03}in the Western Sea...{01}The one you seek awaits.{02}{00}
To the north...in the village{03}that knows no spring...{03}the one you seek awaits.{02}{00}
Head east by southeast... In{03}the desert on the southern{03}land in the Eastern Sea...{01}The one you seek awaits.{02}{00}
Head east by northeast... In a{03}cave on the continent that{03}shifted from its foundations...{01}The one you seek awaits...{02}{00}
To the southeast...in the{03}plains of the southern continent{03}in the Eastern Sea...{01}The one you seek awaits.{02}{00}
To the south...in the forest...{03}the one you seek awaits.{02}{00}
To the east...beside the{03}boulder on the tiny islet...{03}the one you seek awaits.{02}{00}
Head east by northeast...{03}...In the town envolped in mist...{03}the one you seek awaits.{02}{00}
To the north...somewhere{03}on a small island...{03}the one you seek awaits.{02}{00}
Head north by northwest...{03}In a cave on the northern{03}continent in the Western Sea...{01}The one you seek awaits.{02}{00}

Head north by northeast... On{03}the island where the treasure{03}lies...the one you seek awaits...{02}{00}
In the item you have placed{03}before me, I can see nothing{03}of the future...{02}{00}
My father is a fortune-teller,{03}not a witch doctor.{01}There are a great many{03}differences between him{03}and Akafubu of Kibombo.{02}{00}
By painting our bodies, we{03}bring about good luck.{03}You should try it, too.{02}{00}
The items that one carries are{03}filled with one's hopes and{03}desires.{01}I can sense these desires,{03}and I can see answers{03}hidden within them.{02}{00}
My father may not be a witch{03}doctor, but he could easily{03}defeat Akafubu.{02}{00}
Body painting also protects{03}us from the magic of the{03}witch doctor, or so I'm told.{02}{00}
If you are burdened with many{03}concerns, take a weapon{03}to the fortune-teller.{01}He can read your future{03}by studying the weapons{03}that you carry.{02}{00}
I can look at any weapon and{03}see the monsters it faced,{03}but I cannot read its future.{02}{00}
You should visit the fortune-{03}teller while you are in our{03}village.{01}By looking at the items you{03}possess, he can see what it{03}is that troubles you.{02}{00}
Whenever I get my fortune{03}read, I offer up some armor.{01}I think this might be why{03}I find so many rare and{03}valuable artifacts.{02}{00}
No one can see the future.{03}Absolutely no one. Except{03}for our fortune-teller.{01}Just by looking at your{03}items, he can see the path{03}you're meant to follow.{02}{00}
Even if I wanted my fortune{03}told, I don't have any armor{03}or weapons to show him.{01}If he were only willing to{03}look at other items, I'm sure{03}he'd get more business.{02}{00}
If you like adventure, you{03}should head out west{03}across the river...{01}Oh, wait... With all the rain{03}we've had lately, the river is{03}probably too deep to cross.{02}{00}
Our cooking is famous all{03}across Gondowan.{01}If you find you like it,{03}come back soon! We change{03}our menu every season.{02}{00}
The river is probably very{03}dangerous right now.{01}It's filled with monsters{03}when the waters are{03}running high.{02}{00}
Our spices are our secret.{03}Everyone loves spicy food,{03}even if they regret it later.{01}And I'll thump the first{03}person that tries to tell{03}me otherwise!{02}{00}
!{02}{00}
I am but a humble pilgrim,{03}serving the greater good{03}in the heart of Gondowan.{01}Travelers should know that{03}even in this wild land, aid{03}is not far off.{02}{00}
Anywhere I can do some{03}good, I will serve without{03}complaint.{01}Although...it would be nice if{03}it were a little cooler here.{02}{00}
Don't tell me you just came{03}back from Kibombo!{01}You must be really brave{03}to have made it there and{03}back again!{02}{00}
I didn't see any Kibombo{03}soldiers in the mountain{03}pass... Where did they go?{02}{00}
I saw smoke rising from{03}Kibombo... Were they having{03}a bonfire or something?{02}{00}
Some soldiers came through{03}here looking for a guy{03}named {11}{08}.{01}They looked unhappy that{03}I'd never heard of him.{02}{00}
The smoke coming from{03}the Kibombo Mountains is{03}coming from a signal fire.{01}The signals are hard to read,{03}though. Whoever's sending{03}them isn't terribly good at it.{02}{00}
The fortune-teller predicted{03}that the Kibombo will settle{03}down for a time...{01}I hope for all of our sakes{03}that he's right.{02}{00}
A man came through a while{03}ago. He said he was going{03}to Kibombo.{01}He hasn't come back yet.{03}I think the guards in the{03}mountains caught him.{02}{00}
I mentioned Magma Rock{03}to a traveler the other day,{03}and he was very intrigued.{01}I can't be sure, but I think{03}he might have headed in{03}that direction.{02}{00}
Who would travel to{03}Kibombo right now? It's{03}not very safe right now.{02}{00}
I'm so glad the Kibombo{03}aren't lurking over us in{03}the hills anymore...{01}They were here, they{03}were there, they were{03}everywhere!{02}{00}
That smoke's been rising from{03}Kibombo for a while... I doubt{03}it's just a fire...{02}{00}
What kind of a name is{03}{11}{08}. An odd one, certainly.{02}{00}
The signals say something{03}has...ended? Or maybe has{03}been chosen?{01}It's so hard to figure out...{03}I wish they were a little{03}better at smoke signals.{02}{00}
The fortune-teller has never{03}been wrong...{01}But I can't imagine that{03}the Kibombo would ever{03}really calm down.{02}{00}
If the man they were looking{03}for has gone to Kibombo,{03}they're better off waiting.{01}Kibombo is a dangerous{03}place for outsiders right now.{02}{00}
I don't think anyone can{03}reach Magma Rock now.{03}The river is too deep.{02}{00}
Ouch... Some big brute came{03}through here looking for a{03}woman named Menardi.{01}I told him I'd never heard of{03}her, and he shoved me to the{03}ground and stormed off!{02}{00}
What has gone wrong with{03}the world? People have no{03}respect for their elders!{02}{00}
I guess those warriors learned{03}much about their future from{03}the fortune-teller.{01}You should do the same.{03}Bring your items to him,{03}just as they did.{02}{00}
Our fortune-teller has been{03}saying some horrible things{03}lately.{01}He's been telling everyone{03}that "our peace shall soon{03}sleep." It's not very comforting.{02}{00}
The power of the fortune-teller{03}is great. Anyone who listens to{03}his advice benefits greatly.{02}{00}
The fortune-teller said that the{03}power of nature would rekindle{03}the advance of civilization.{01}But which is better, an{03}advanced civilization, or{03}a peaceful one?{02}{00}
If trouble resides in your{03}heart, I suggest you speak{03}with my father.{02}{00}
Reading fortunes in people's{03}items takes a lot of energy, so{03}he's not always willing to do it.{01}But if you have 20 coins on{03}you, he might be a little more{03}willing.{02}{00}
Items placed before me are filled{03}with the desires of those{03}who place them there.{01}If I can sense those desires, I{03}can answer that which they seek.{02}{00}
Father should charge{03}more for his readings.{01}People profit from what he{03}tells them. Why shouldn't{03}he profit from telling them?{02}{00}
After Father's been reading{03}all day, he sleeps like a baby.{03}A really loud, snoring baby.{02}{00}
Whenever I get customers{03}from out of town, I always{03}tell them the same thing...{01}"The fortune-teller sees all."{03}Nobody can resist trying{03}it at least once.{02}{00}
When I look at weapons, I{03}can instantly tell what{03}monsters they have fought.{02} {00}
If you wish to know anything,{03}go to the fortune-teller. He's{03}fast, accurate, and affordable.{02}{00}
I like offering armor to the{03}fortune-teller. It usually{03}gets me good results.{02}{00}
Strangers to our town{03}would do well to visit the{03}fortune-teller's hut.{02}{00}
Those who become lost should{03}offer the fortune-teller one{03}of their hard-earned items.{02}{00}
If {11}{08} is traveling{03}in your group, please give{03}him this message:{01}{11}{01} and his companions{03}would like to speak{03}with him.{02}{00}
I see so many travelers...{03}How am I supposed to{03}remember who {11}{08} is?{01}And why would anyone come{03}all the way to Gondowan to{03}find him? What does {11}{01} want?{02}{00}
He paid me a lot of money{03}to pass this message on, but{03}how would he know if I didn't?{01}Ah, I'm too honest for my own{03}good. I'll keep passing {11}{01}'s{03}message on to my guests.{02}{00}
Why would {11}{01} travel{03}all this way in search of a{03}man he has never met?{01}What could it be that drives{03}him to look for this{03}{11}{08}?{02}{00}
!{02}{00}
It's strange. As hot as it is{03}here in Gondowan, if you head{03}south, it's bitter cold...{01}The land of Tundaria is{03}a frozen wasteland that{03}deserves its name.{02}{00}
The cold of Tundaria stifles{03}virtually all living things.{01}Compared to that barren land,{03}Gondowan's heat is comforting.{02}{00}
Akafubu's ceremony is set to{03}begin soon. I wonder if he'll{03}succeed this time.{02}{00}
During the last ceremony,{03}Akafubu made the jewel{03}float in the air...{01}But the mouth of the Great{03}Gabomba did not open.{02}{00}
I'm afraid of what Akafubu{03}will do if he fails the{03}ceremony a second time.{02}{00}
During the last ceremony,{03}the Great Gabomba didn't{03}move. It just stared silently.{02}{00}
It's strange that Akafubu{03}decided to try again tonight.{03}What bolstered his confidence?{02}{00}
The Great Gabomba is{03}supposed to open his{03}mouth if Akafubu is worthy.{02}{00}
When he fails the ceremony,{03}Akafubu gets so angry...{01}I hope he doesn't turn his{03}anger on to me... I'm afraid{03}of his powerful magic.{02}{00}
It would be great to see the{03}Gabomba open its mouth. Please,{03}Akafubu... Do it right this time!{02}{00}
I hope the Great Gabomba is{03}satisfied by Akafubu's jewel{03}and opens his mouth this time.{02}{00}
Is making the jewel float{03}with the power of his mind{03}all there is to it?{01}I would have thought a ceremony{03}like this would have required{03}a little more effort.{02}{00}
Rumor has it that after failing the{03}last time, Akafubu sat alone in{03}the shadows, crying to himself.{02}{00}
When the Gabomba is angered,{03}his eyes glow with rage and{03}fire shoots out of his mouth.{02}{00}
If the Great Gabomba opens{03}his mouth, he will have{03}acknowledged Akafubu's power.{01}When the Great Gabomba{03}accepts the jewel,{03}the door will open.{02}{00}
He's failed so many times{03}already...{01}Won't the same thing happen{03}again if he tries it another time?{02}{00}
As Oeia's disciple, Akafubu{03}had a bad reputation for always{03}crying and complaining.{02}{00}
I hope Akafubu hasn't angered{03}the Great Gabomba. I would be{03}sorry to see him die like that...{02}{00}
I think Akafubu will speak of the{03}great witch doctor Oeia's fate.{02}{00}
Akafubu was a good man{03}when he was training with{03}Oeia...{01}After Oeia died, Akafubu was{03}simply no longer the same.{02}{00}
Akafubu looks really confident{03}tonight. I think he just might{03}succeed this time!{02}{00}
If the Great Gabomba likes{03}the jewel, his mouth will open{03}and his tongue will stick out.{01}It sounds weird, but it's a{03}sign that the Gabomba{03}accepts the offering.{02}{00}
Akafubu is so different{03}from Oeia, so impatient.{01}Why did Oeia have to{03}leave us so suddenly?{02}{00}
Akafubu has not yet attained{03}the magical skill that Oeia{03}possessed...{01}I worry for our future if{03}Akafubu's character is as{03}weak as his magic.{02}{00}
He travels to Madra and returns{03}with a stolen gem, and now he{03}expects us to call him a hero?{02}{00}
If the Great Gabomba actually{03}moves and sticks out his tongue...{03}I might just faint!{02}{00}
Akafubu has tried this before,{03}but he has always failed.{01}Tonight is different, though. With{03}this new gem, he may succeed.{02}{00}
Hey, no pushing! You're not{03}going to get any closer, with{03}all these people packed in here.{02}{00}
The heat is terrible tonight...{03}Of course, it's not so much the{03}heat as it is the humidity...{01}At this point, I don't care if{03}Akafubu ever succeeds, just{03}so long as he's quick about it!{02}{00}
My grandfather spoke of a time{03}when the Gabomba was so{03}angry that its eyes popped out!{01}After that, he says, nothing good{03}ever happened in Kibombo.{03}Nothing. It was a bad omen.{02}{00}
As a child, Akafubu was every{03}bit as horrible. He always cried{03}when he had to share his toys.{01}When he was good, he was{03}very, very good...but when{03}he was bad, he was AWFUL.{02}{00}
There are so many people here!{03}If I want to see the ceremony,{03}I'll have to climb the posts!{02}{00}
If Akafubu hopes to become{03}our witch doctor, he'll have{03}to enter the Great Gabomba.{01}He's a slow child... It'll take him{03}a while, I can tell.{02}{00}
I wonder what Oeia did to{03}make the Great Gabomba's{03}eyes pop out...{02}{00}
Akafubu is attempting the{03}ceremony again tonight.{01}Oeia performed the same{03}ceremony with no problems.{03}What's holding Akafubu back?{02}{00}
Akafubu seems perturbed{03}lately. I think his failures are{03}weighing heavily on him.{01}He seems pompous, but it's{03}only his lack of confidence{03}showing through.{02}{00}
He who is the witch doctor of{03}Kibombo holds the most revered{03}office in our whole town.{02}{00}
Oeia's sudden death brought{03}pressure and responsibility on{03}Akafubu, well before his time.{02}{00}
Oeia was a great witch doctor{03}and a compassionate leader.{01}Poor Akafubu... He may be a good{03}man, but he will never match Oeia.{02}{00}
Once, these ceremonies were{03}guided by both the witch doctor{03}and his apprentice.{01}Akafubu is little more than an{03}apprentice himself... It's no{03}surprise that he struggles so.{02}{00}
If only Oeia had taught his{03}magic to someone else...{01}If he had another pupil, this{03}would go more easily on poor{03}Akafubu. He would not be alone.{02}{00}
I wonder if Akafubu even wanted{03}to study magic or to become{03}Oeia's sucessor.{02}{00}
Akafubu blames his failures{03}on the jewel he originally used.{03}He claims it was no good.{01}That's why he led a team of{03}soldiers to find a new one.{02}{00}
Akafubu used his abilities to see{03}the future. That's how he knew{03}to find the jewel in Madra.{02}{00}
If the Great Gabomba's mouth{03}doesn't open, Akafubu must not{03}yet be a true witch doctor.{02}{00}
I wonder what will happen tonight.{03}I'm so anxious, I can't stand it.{03}When will everything start?{02}{00}
They attacked some town{03}to get the jewel he needed.{03}I hope no one was injured.{02}{00}
I wonder how accurate Akafubu's{03}predictions are...{01}I mean, if he were any good,{03}shouldn't he be able to predict{03}the outcome of this ceremony?{02}{00}
I feel so much excitement...{03}At last, will the Great Gabomba{03}recognize Akafubu's strength?{02}{00}
I can't explain it, but I have a{03}feeling that, tonight, Akafubu's{03}ceremony will be different.{02}{00}
At last, the sacred night{03}has come!{02}{00}
Tonight, Akafubu becomes the{03}Kibombo's new witch doctor!{02}{00}
All of you, pray in the{03}depths of your hearts{03}for my success!{02}{00}
It looks like the initiation{03}ceremony is beginning.{02}{00}
I'm not sure what will happen,{03}but we'd better hurry, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
Wh-Who are you?!?{02}{00}
What... What are your intentions?{02}{00}
It looks like {11}{08} has{03}already forgotten us, huh?{1E}{00}
I know! We met {11}{08} when{03}he was in JAIL! And it's not like{03}he had lots of visitors, either!{02}{00}
What, is he so obsessed with{03}his black orb that he can't{03}even remember us?{02}{00}
Wait a second... I know you...{02}{00}
You're the travelers who came{03}seeking me when I was in jail.{02}{00}
So, you {09}{02}do{07} remember!{02}{00}
What are you doing{03}in this place?{02}{00}
Actually, that's what we{03}wanted to ask you...{02}{00}
We were worried about you,{03}{11}{08}, so we followed{03}you here...{02}{00}
And that's what brings you{03}to this dangerous place?{02}{00}
What's that supposed to mean?{02}{00}
We came here to help you,{03}{11}{08}. Why are you being{03}like that about it?{02}{00}
Tell me something...{03}Exactly when did I ask{03}you for your help?{02}{00}
SILENCE!{02}{00}
I shall now present our jewel{03}to the Great Gabomba!{02}{00}
!!!{02}{00}
O Great Gabomba!{03}Please accept this,{03}our humble gift!{02}{00}
Please, Great Gabomba!{03}Accept this jewel!{02}{00}
Look! The Great Gabomba has{03}noticed the light of the jewel!{02}{00}
Why, Great Gabomba?{02}{00}
Your prayers were weak!{03}Open your hearts to the{03}Great Gabomba!{02}{00}
Sing your praises and dance for{03}the Great Gabomba until your{03}prayers reach his ears!{02}{00}
Akafubu is no witch doctor!{03}He's an Adept!{02}{00}
I may have to confront{03}him to get my orb back...{03}I may have to fight.{02}{00}
I will do whatever it takes,{03}but I will have my black{03}orb back again.{02}{00}
It's no use. We can't get to{03}Akafubu from here.{02}{00}
This won't work, either...{03}What are we going to do?{03}We can't get over there!{02}{00}
{11}{08}'s in trouble.{03}Shouldn't we try to help him?{02}{00}
Maybe if we could do something{03}about that stump, we could reach{03}the backside of Gabomba.{02}{00}
We've got to help {11}{08}.{03}Right, {11}{05}?{1E}{00}
Then hop to it!{02}{00}
What's all this now, {11}{05}?{03}Is it too much to ask that you{03}help {11}{08} in his time of need?{02}{00}
He seems to believe{03}we are enemies...{02}{00}
I hope he doesn't think{03}we're with the Kibombo.{02}{00}
I must admit, you don't{03}look much like Kibombo...{02}{00}
But that begs the question, if{03}you're not Kibombo, then who are{03}you, and why have you come here?{02}{00}
They are...warriors.{03}But how did you{03}get in here?{02}{00}
Why are these warriors{03}in a place like this?{02}{00}
I'm not sure how to answer that...{02}{00}
Actually, we've been looking for{03}a boat... We kinda need one.{02}{00}
You're looking for a boat...{03}in the middle of the continent?{03}That seems like a bad idea.{02}{00}
Hey, this wasn't exactly{03}our first choice, you know?{02}{00}
A tidal wave destroyed all the{03}boats in the coastal towns.{02}{00}
You're asking me to believe{03}rather a lot, don't you think?{02}{00}
SILENCE!{02}{00}
I shall now present our jewel{03}to the Great Gabomba!{02}{00}
!!!{02}{00}
O Great Gabomba!{03}Please accept this,{03}our humble gift!{02}{00}
Please, Great Gabomba!{03}Accept this jewel!{02}{00}
Look! The Great Gabomba has{03}noticed the light of the jewel!{02}{00}
Gabomba, why?{02}{00}
Your prayers were weak!{03}Open your hearts to the{03}Great Gabomba!{02}{00}
Sing your praises and dance for{03}the Great Gabomba until your{03}prayers reach his ears!{02}{00}
Akafubu is no witch doctor!{03}He's an Adept!{02}{00}
I may have to confront{03}him to get my orb back...{03}I may have to fight.{02}{00}
I will do whatever it takes,{03}but I will have my black{03}orb back again.{02}{00}
It's no use. We can't get to{03}Akafubu from here.{02}{00}
This won't work, either...{03}What are we going to do?{03}We can't get over there!{02}{00}
{11}{08}'s in trouble.{03}Shouldn't we try to help him?{02}{00}
Maybe if we could do something{03}about that stump, we could reach{03}the backside of Gabomba.{02}{00}
We've got to help {11}{08}.{03}Right, {11}{05}?{1E}{00}
Then hop to it!{02}{00}
What's all this now, {11}{05}?{03}Is it too much to ask that you{03}help {11}{08} in his time of need?{02}{00}
Well, if you're going to help him,{03}you'd better do something about{03}the stump blocking the path...{02}{00}
The orb is right before me,{03}and yet I cannot reach it...{02}{00}
I am certain I just sensed the{03}power of Psynergy, but that{03}can't possibly be...{02}{00}
?!?{02}{00}
That power... Was that{03}Psynergy?{1E}{00}
I knew it!{02}{00}
Please, don't try to complicate{03}things by lying... It must have{03}been Psynergy...{02}{00}
I should have spotted it at once!{03}You're Adepts!{02}{00}
Wait, so does that mean you're{B0}{02}{00}
Yes, my name is {11}{08},{03}and I too am an Adept.{02}{00}
To be honest, everyone in{03}Lemuria is an Adept, and{03}not just me.{02}{00}
What's Lemuria?{02}{00}
Lemuria is an island that lies{03}in the center of the Eastern Sea.{02}{00}
Wait a second... You said Lemuria?{03}I've heard that name before...{02}{00}
Of course! It was Lord Babi!{03}He often spoke to me of Lemuria.{02}{00}
He said it was so advanced that{03}we can scarcely begin to imagine{03}what it must have been like...{02}{00}
You are correct. My home was and{03}is all that you say. Whoever told{03}you this knows much of Lemuria.{02}{00}
But wait, if it's so far away in{03}the middle of the ocean, how come{03}anyone knows so much about it?{02}{00}
It is not easily reached, and{03}we Lemurians seldom leave...{01}I cannot imagine how anyone{03}could have learned anything at{03}all about us.{02}{00}
Except... Hold on a moment...{03}Babi... I've heard that name{03}somewhere before...{02}{00}
Well, yeah... Everyone knows{03}about Lord Babi... He's the ruler{03}of Tolbi...{02}{00}
I've never heard of Tolbi. Until{03}recently, I had never left my{03}home of Lemuria...{02}{00}
{11}{08}, are you just{03}playing games with us?{02}{00}
Don't be foolish. What would{03}I gain from lying to you?{02}{00}
I'm being quite serious.{02}{00}
{11}{08} is not playing{03}games, {11}{06}. You can{03}trust him.{02}{00}
Thank you for believing{03}me, master sage!{02}{00}
Please, call me Kraden,{03}{11}{08} of Lemuria.{02}{00}
And I am the one who should{03}be thanking you!{02}{00}
You look puzzled, {11}{05}.{03}You are probably wondering{03}what I'm talking about...{1E}{00}
Oh, good! Then I probably{03}don't need to tell you...{02}{00}
Wait, just because my brother{03}knows what you're talking about{03}doesn't mean we do! Tell us!{02}{00}
I thought as much...{02}{00}
If what Babi told me is true,{03}Lemuria is all that remains of{03}a once great civilization.{02}{00}
Your friend is correct.{02}{00}
In fact, the reason I was sent to{03}Vale was somewhat related to my{03}inability to find Lemuria itself...{02}{00}
I don't understand... What was{03}in Vale that had anything to{03}do with Lemuria?{02}{00}
Babi believed that, in Lemuria{03}alone, the power of Alchemy{03}remains unbound.{02}{00}
Lord Babi had need of Lemuria's{03}Alchemy, but despite our effort,{03}we could not find the lost city.{02}{00}
Since we could not find Lemuria,{03}Lord Babi sent me to unlock the{03}secrets of Alchemy myself.{02}{00}
Ah, yes! Babi! If I recall correctly,{03}a man named Babi came to{03}Lemuria long ago...{02}{00}
He stole one of our ships{03}and fled the isle...{02}{00}
Yes! That must indeed be the{03}same Lord Babi who know{03}leads the people of Tolbi.{02}{00}
Now, I'm even more confused.{03}This is making my head hurt...{02}{00}
I mean, if Babi really stole a ship{03}from your home, why would he be{03}trying so hard to find it again?{02}{00}
I can't expect you to understand,{03}my dear. Lord Babi's reasons for{03}finding Lemuria are...complex.{02}{00}
But if he already found Lemuria{03}once, why doesn't he just go{03}back the same way?{02}{00}
Once you have left Lemuria,{03}finding it again is quite difficult,{03}even if you know where to look.{02}{00}
Well...why?{02}{00}
The waters around Lemuria are{03}wrapped in a perpetual fog...{03}It is very difficult to navigate.{02}{00}
I remember Lord Babi once{03}saying something to that effect.{02}{00}
Even if one locates Lemuria,{03}getting through the fog itself{03}remains quite a challenge.{02}{00}
I don't get it... Why can't you{03}just sail straight through it?{02}{00}
The ocean currents around{03}Lemuria are swift and{03}treacherous...{01}Only one who can sail{03}a Lemurian ship can{03}complete the journey.{02}{00}
But...Babi stole a Lemurian ship{03}from you, right? That means that{03}he can sail it...{01}You said yourself that he used{03}it to flee the island!{02}{00}
Unfortunately, Babi was the only{03}one of us who could use the ship.{02}{00}
You see, Lemurian ships can only{03}be helmed by Adepts...{02}{00}
Which is why I have to get my{03}black orb back! I must be able{03}to captain my ship!{02}{00}
There may be something up{03}ahead on this path.{02}{00}
Then let's go...{02}{00}
Wait a moment, {11}{08}...{02}{00}
We want to help you{03}get your orb back.{02}{00}
You intend to help{03}me, Kraden?{02}{00}
I am on this quest for many{03}reasons...one of them being{03}that I wish to see Lemuria.{02}{00}
If you would allow me, that is...{03}I'd like to visit Lemuria myself.{02}{00}
If this is something you would do{03}for Babi, then I cannot permit it.{02}{00}
What? Why not?{02}{00}
Babi is a thief. He is not{03}well loved in Lemuria.{02}{00}
It is partially on behalf of Babi...{03}...but there's more to it than that!{02}{00}
I want to go to Lemuria so{03}that I can see the full power{03}of Alchemy!{02}{00}
I want to aid {11}{08} so that{03}he will take us to Lemuria...{03}What do you say, {11}{05}?{1E}{00}
You'll do it!?{03}Splendid!{02}{00}
Why, {11}{05}? Why?{03}Please, we simply have to!{02}{00}
What's the matter with you,{03}{11}{05}? I don't see why{03}we can't help {11}{08}.{02}{00}
Yeah. I'm with {11}{06}{03}on this one.{02}{00}
I appreciate your offer,{03}but...{02}{00}
I understand, {11}{08}...{03}You're not sure if you'll be able{03}to take us to Lemuria, is that it?{02}{00}
Can't we talk about this later?{02}{00}
Yes, yes, of course! For now,{03}let's just get that orb back{03}for {11}{08}!{02}{00}
Now that I know the orb is here,{03}I won't leave this village without{03}it! I will go alone if I must!{02}{00}
You've come to help me get my{03}orb back? Thank you, all of you!{02}{00}
Oh... Oh my... I've heard of{03}ceremonies like these... Foreign{03}deities are so frightening...{02}{00}
Hmm?{02}{00}
So, the ceremony is finally{03}over. Well! Isn't that...nice...{02}{00}
I wonder if a man in my{03}position should really be{03}in a place like this.{02}{00}
It's a dead end...{02}{00}
But this was the only path...{02}{00}
Isn't it a little strange that{03}there would be a path that{03}just goes nowhere like this?{02}{00}
Hmm...{02}{00}
I see...{02}{00}
So that's how it works...{02}{00}
Listen up, {11}{05}...{02}{00}
Dig there!{1E}{00}
Don't worry. Just use Scoop...{03}You'll see why in just a{03}few seconds...{02}{00}
I see...{02}{00}
What's this?{02}{00}
Someone has put something{03}in the ground here.{02}{00}
And this statue...{02}{00}
Well, take a look...{02}{00}
{11}{05}! Try using Scoop{03}around there!{02}{00}
Ah... I thought so...{02}{00}
You thought what?{02}{00}
These marks are here to{03}indicate an entrance there,{03}in the center of the design...{02}{00}
You mean we can go{03}inside this statue?{02}{00}
You could at one point...{02}{00}
The entrance was probably{03}beneath that stone.{02}{00}
I wonder... Was this the only one?{02}{00}
It seems that way...{02}{00}
Man, if this was the only entrance,{03}then I feel bad for the people{03}who built this statue.{02}{00}
Why is that?{02}{00}
Well, if this is the only hole,{03}then there's no way for air to{03}get in or out...{01}It must have been really{03}hot when they were working{03}in there!{02}{00}
I...hadn't even thought of that.{02}{00}
We must inspect this area{03}carefully, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
{11}{06} has raised{03}an interesting point...{02}{00}
If people did indeed build this,{03}they would not have been able{03}to do it without an air supply.{02}{00}
They might have opened a vent{03}somewhere nearby.{02}{00}
And if so, then there may have{03}been a ladder to enter the vent.{03}We should try to find it.{02}{00}
Kraden, there doesn't seem{03}to be anything of the sort here!{02}{00}
What were we just looking at?{02}{00}
If there is a vent shaft, it{03}would probably be quite old,{03}maybe even buried...{01}Exactly like those marks we{03}just uncovered!{02}{00}
And if that's the case, we{03}should search more thoroughly.{02}{00}
OK, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
Focus your energies!{02}{00}
Everyone! Look over here!{02}{00}
Let us now present our jewel{03}to the Great Gabomba!{02}{00}
O Great Gabomba!{03}Please accept this,{03}our humble gift!{02}{00}
Please, Great Gabomba!{03}Accept this jewel!{02}{00}
Look! The Great Gabomba has{03}noticed the light of the jewel!{02}{00}
You are still not pleased?{02}{00}
No! This time, he seemed{03}almost like he might...{02}{00}
We must continue!{03}Drums! More drums!{02}{00}
Ah! So that's how it works!{02}{00}
He's been failing because{03}the conduit that channels{03}his Psynergy is broken.{02}{00}
Should we reconnect the{03}conduit so he can complete{03}the ceremony?{1E}{00}
I won't help them, {11}{05}!{03}They're the ones who stole my{03}orb from the Madrans!{02}{00}
I agree, {11}{05}!{03}Why should we help this{03}pack of thieves?{02}{00}
{11}{08}, I understand that{03}you're angry at them, but it really{03}is in our best interest to help.{02}{00}
Think about it, {11}{08}...{03}Akafubu stole the orb solely to{03}perform this ceremony...{02}{00}
So, what do you think he{03}intends to do with the orb?{02}{00}
He means to give it to{03}the Great Gabomba...{02}{00}
Oh! So...if his ceremony succeeds,{03}the orb will be taken into the{03}statue...{02}{00}
And we're INSIDE the statue!{03}If the ceremony succeeds,{03}we can go find the orb!{02}{00}
I...don't want to help{03}that Akafubu, but...{02}{00}
I don't like the idea of helping{03}him any more than you do, but{03}if we can end this without a fight...{02}{00}
You're right, {11}{07}. Let's see{03}if we can't help him finish{03}his little ceremony.{02}{00}
It looks like the energy charge{03}is supposed to run over these{03}blocks.{02}{00}
If we can just move these around{03}a little, that might be enough to{03}complete the circuit...{02}{00}
Ah! There we go!{02}{00}
These panels have arrows on{03}them... What do you think it{03}all means?{02}{00}
Look at the directions they{03}point... I'll bet these will{03}rotate the blocks...{02}{00}
But how do we set the{03}blocks back in place?{02}{00}
Just Pound them in!{02}{00}
Won't that do the trick?{02}{00}
We must watch the path his{03}Psynergy takes and move{03}the blocks accordingly.{02}{00}
Oh! The magic, the power of{03}the witch doctor fills my body!{02}{00}
At the count of twenty, I{03}shall present our jewel to{03}the Great Gabomba!{02}{00}
Make your hearts as one,{03}and dance for the Great{03}Gabomba!{02}{00}
O Great Gabomba!{03}Please accept this,{03}our humble gift!{02}{00}
You are still not pleased?{02}{00}
No! This time, he seemed{03}almost like he might...{02}{00}
We must continue!{03}Drums! More drums!{02}{00}
Look! Look! The Great Gabomba{03}has seen our jewel!{02}{00}
Ahh! We have enraged{03}the Great Gabomba!{02}{00}
No! Great catastrophe shall{03}befall the Kibombo!{02}{00}
Silence! SILENCE!{02}{00}
Do not be hasty! The Great{03}Gabomba has not opened{03}his eyes in anger!{02}{00}
Your prayers...have not{03}appeased him... That is all!{02}{00}
Pray! You must pray more!{03}Let the Great Gabomba hear{03}our desires!{02}{00}
Drums! More drums!!!{02}{00}
Look! The Great Gabomba has{03}responded to our gift!{02}{00}
Wahhh! The Great Gabomba{03}spews jets of flame!{02}{00}
It is the end of Kibombo!{03}Our village is doomed!{02}{00}
Silence! SILENCE!{02}{00}
Do not be hasty, my people!{03}The Great Gabomba is not{03}angered by our ceremony!{02}{00}
He is angered by the presence{03}of wicked thoughts!{02}{00}
Cast away your wicked{03}thoughts! Dance! Dance{03}for the Great Gabomba!{02}{00}
Drums! More drums!!!{02}{00}
Look! The Great Gabomba has{03}responded to our gift!{02}{00}
Did you see it, people?{02}{00}
At last! The Great Gabomba{03}accepts me!{02}{00}
I shall answer his call! I shall{03}enter the Great Gabomba!{03}Wait for me, my people!{02}{00}
The black orb... Where is it?{02}{00}
I saw it roll in there...{02}{00}
It came in through there{03}and rolled along this{03}groove in the floor...{02}{00}
It vanished into that hole!{02}{00}
It looks pretty deep...{02}{00}
Can you see it? Do you{03}think you can reach it?{02}{00}
Hm... No, I can't even see it.{02}{00}
It's no use... Now, I'll never{03}see Lemuria again... I am lost{03}forever from my homeland!{02}{00}
Wait, hold on... I can see light{03}on the other side of this hole...{02}{00}
A light?{02}{00}
There must be a room{03}on the other side of{03}this statue...{02}{00}
Who... Who are you!?{02}{00}
What are you doing here?{03}Are you Kibombo!?{1E}{00}
What? Do you take me for{03}a naive fool!?{02}{00}
Then what are you doing{03}inside the Great Gabomba!?{02}{00}
We've come to reclaim the{03}black orb you stole!{02}{00}
Do you really believe{03}I would permit you to{03}take it!?{02}{00}
Hey, watch it! You wouldn't{03}even be in here if it weren't{03}for us!{02}{00}
What is that supposed to mean?{02}{00}
Why should I believe you?{03}I am Akafubu, the chosen{03}witch doctor of Kibombo!{02}{00}
Yeah, we know... We saw your{03}magic energy flowing past us.{02}{00}
See how this channel runs{03}along the floor?{02}{00}
Here, look... It runs all the{03}way over there!{02}{00}
But the thing is, the circuit{03}was broken right there.{02}{00}
So we completed the circuit so{03}that your magic energy could{03}go where it needed to go.{02}{00}
But...if you truly did this,{03}then why? Why did you{03}help me?{02}{00}
We were sort of hoping that{03}we could take the orb if your{03}ceremony succeeded...{02}{00}
Ah, so you have taken the orb?{03}Then begone! You have no{03}further business here!{02}{00}
But...we didn't get the orb.{02}{00}
It rolled through this groove{03}and right through this hole.{02}{00}
We saw a light through there,{03}so we suspect there must be{03}another room behind the wall...{02}{00}
I might be able to{03}retrieve the orb.{02}{00}
Do you think Akafubu will really{03}return the orb to us?{1E}{00}
Maybe we had him all wrong...{02}{00}
I think {11}{06} is right.{03}It sounds like he's going to{03}return what he has stolen.{02}{00}
I thought Akafubu was an evil{03}man, but I guess we were wrong...{02}{00}
You never can tell, {11}{07}...{02}{00}
We have little choice but to{03}trust that he will return it.{03}Come on!{02}{00}
Let's go, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
Ahh! Something is coming{03}from within the Great Gabomba!{03}Are you men, or are you...gods?{02}{00}
You look human...but perhaps{03}you are the ones who created the{03}Great Gabomba, reborn before us!{02}{00}
Akafubu possesses the power{03}to enter the Great Gabomba! My{03}faith is restored!{02}{00}
We must stand guard and{03}wait until Akafubu's return!{02}{00}
Men or gods, we fear you not!{01}The Kibombo fear nothing!{02}{00}
It seems these beasts want{03}to pass through...{01}Can't you see we are in the{03}midst of our ceremony!?{01}None shall pass until{03}it is complete!{02}{00}
This isn't a bad way to spend{03}an evening, when you get right{03}down to it.{01}I could dance all night{03}and all day tomorrow, too.{02}{00}
It is proper for a warrior to{03}be a man of few words.{01}It is the fearful dog who{03}barks the loudest.{02}{00}
They look like people, but how{03}could they be here now? I cannot{03}believe it!{01}Why doesn't my magic{03}amulet have any effect{03}on them?{02}{00}
If no person other than Akafubu{03}can enter the Great Gabomba...{01}Then these people{03}aren't really people{03}at all!{02}{00}
I saw Akafubu's power open{03}the jaw of the Great Gabomba.{01}I saw it happen, but I still{03}don't believe it. But...{03}I SAW it happen...{02}{00}
I hope Akafubu completes{03}the ceremony soon... I'm so{03}sleepy... I want to go home.{02}{00}
What if the Great Gabomba only{03}opened its mouth to lure Akafubu{03}in and...crush him like a grape!{02}{00}
Look at these guys. They think{03}they're so hot... I bet they think{03}they're gonna get past me...{01}They have no idea how long I{03}can stand here, saying the same{03}thing to them, over and over.{02}{00}
Sure, this is fun, but my feet{03}hurt! I never want to hear an{03}irresistible dance beat again!{02}{00}
*Koff! Koff!* All this chanting is{03}making my throat hurt! No more{03}singing in the shower for me.{02}{00}
Akafubu has been inside the{03}Great Gabomba for a while now.{03}How long is he going to take?{02}{00}
I think Akafubu's has finally{03}succeeded at his ceremony.{01}Maybe Kibombo will finally{03}be peaceful once again.{02}{00}
Tonight seems to have been{03}a good night... I was worried,{03}since Akafubu kept failing.{02}{00}
Once the ceremony is complete,{03}Kibombo will be like a village{03}reborn. Peace will come again.{02}{00}
What? Don't ask me what{03}Akafubu's doing in there. I{03}was just wondering myself.{02}{00}
They say the Great Gabomba's{03}great jaw finally opened.{01}I wish I could go up front{03}and get a better view.{02}{00}
They told me I had to stay{03}awake until the ceremony's{03}over.{01}Usually, they tell me I have{03}to go to bed early! Make up{03}your minds already!{02}{00}
Whew! Thank goodness those{03}drums have stopped. They{03}were rattling my brain!{02}{00}
Last time Akafubu tried the{03}ceremony, he failed. I saw him{03}crying behind the statue after.{02}{00}
Oeia's death was so sudden.{03}It's been hard on Akafubu.{02}{00}
Akafubu sees the future...{03}That's how he knew to{03}find the jewel in Madra.{02}{00}
I believe in Akafubu. I believe{03}he will surpass Oeia and{03}become a great witch doctor.{02}{00}
What's taking so long? We{03}can't finish the ceremony until{03}Akafubu comes back out.{02}{00}
Akafubu is obsessed! He'll{03}keep trying this until he{03}gets it right.{01}Please, oh please, just{03}get it right tonight!!!{02}{00}
Will the Great Gabomba finally{03}accept Akafubu and make him{03}our new witch doctor?{02}{00}
Kibombo was so much better{03}when Oeia was our leader.{01}I wish we could return to that{03}life once again...{02}{00}
I'm so far away from the action...{03}From back here, Akafubu looks{03}like a deranged mosquito!{02}{00}
They're saying the Great Gabomba{03}opened his mouth, but I'll just{03}have to take their word for it.{01}I wish I were closer, so I could{03}see it and know for sure.{02}{00}
As long as this ceremony's{03}going on, I get to stay up!{01}Normally, I get in trouble for{03}trying to stay up this late.{02}{00}
Am I going to have to play{03}drums all night? Can't they{03}just...dance without them?{02}{00}
Akafubu's always been a{03}crybaby. Whenever he failed{03}his lessons, he cried and cried.{02}{00}
I suspect Akafubu never really{03}wanted to become the Kibombo{03}witch doctor. Poor boy.{02}{00}
I really wonder how accurate{03}Akafubu's farsight is.{01}If his skills were stronger, he{03}should be able to prophesy the{03}outcome of this ceremony.{02}{00}
Akafubu and Oeia are so{03}different... How can he ever{03}hope to replace Oeia?{01}Ah, why did Oeia have{03}to die? What are we to do?{02}{00}
I have followed Oeia's{03}instructions and entered{03}the final chamber!{02}{00}
He told me that if I reached{03}this chamber, I would become{03}Kibombo's witch doctor.{02}{00}
But what must I do here to{03}become a witch doctor?{02}{00}
I do not know...{02}{00}
Your black orb rests in the hands{03}of the statue before you. Go on,{03}take it.{02}{00}
Oeia... What am I to do now?{02}{00}
Oh, young witch doctor... You{03}have succeeded in your task.{03}You have found this chamber.{02}{00}
Wh-Who speaks?{02}{00}
It sounded like it was the{03}statue of the Great Gabomba.{02}{00}
That's ridiculous...{02}{00}
Akafubu! Your magic has grown{03}strong! At last, you are worthy{03}of the title witch doctor.{02}{00}
I give you the feathers and{03}gown that are the badges{03}of your office!{02}{00}
Akafubu, from this day{03}forward, you shall be{03}Kibombo's witch doctor.{02}{00}
I've done it! I've finally earned{03}the right to be witch doctor!{02}{00}
At last!{02}{00}
Yes!{02}{00}
And there is one thing that{03}remains for me to give you...{02}{00}
Akafubu... You hasty fool... I had{03}something else to give you, and{03}in your haste, you left too soon.{02}{00}
Say, you there...{02}{00}
Yes! You! You, looking{03}around there!{02}{00}
I have magic for Akafubu,{03}magic that he will soon need,{03}...but he is not ready for it.{02}{00}
As a result, I have decided that{03}I shall not pass this magic on{03}to anyone just yet.{02}{00}
Tell this to Akafubu:{03}If he desires this new magic,{03}then he must earn it himself!{02}{00}
If Akafubu does not refine his{03}magical arts, then he will never{03}earn this new power.{02}{00}
This power shall not be realized{03}until he ceases living only for{03}himself...{01}And instead lives his{03}life to benefit others.{02}{00}
Tell him so!{02}{00}
I don't suppose you could{03}just...give that magic to us?{02}{00}
What do you mean?{02}{00}
I'm just asking if maybe we{03}could earn that magic before{03}Akafubu.{02}{00}
The power can be claimed by{03}another, but only if Akafubu{03}lacks the will to earn it himself.{02}{00}
Aha! So we CAN get it!{02}{00}
Perhaps if he must compete{03}for his power, he will focus{03}and take his office seriously.{02}{00}
But before you do this thing,{03}you must convey to Akafubu{03}all that I have told you.{02}{00}
Oh, of course! We wouldn't{03}dream of cheating him... We will{03}tell him all you have told us.{02}{00}
Follow that path, and you{03}will find a cavern...{02}{00}
But now, I shall sleep...until{03}the time comes when I must{03}anoint a new witch doctor.{02}{00}
{11}{05}... Go get {11}{08}'s{03}precious orb.{02}{00}
{11}{05}... Do you have any{03}idea exactly what this "Great{03}Gabomba" really is?{1E}{00}
If you have unraveled that{03}which I cannot, then perhaps{03}you are the greater scholar.{02}{00}
You do not understand either?{03}Then I do not feel quite so{03}foolish...{02}{00}
But doesn't this witch doctor{03}magic seem not unlike some{03}kind of Psynergy?{02}{00}
Wouldn't it be quite fortunate{03}if we were to get our hands{03}on that power ourselves?{1E}{00}
Oh! You didn't need{03}much convincing at{03}all, did you, {11}{05}?{02}{00}
Hrmm... You would feel guilty{03}about taking it, eh, {11}{05}?{02}{00}
I needn't remind you, but...{01}We're going to need every{03}kind of Psynergy we can muster{03}to complete this quest...{02}{00}
Either way, {11}{05}, we are,{03}at the very least, obligated to{03}deliver the Gabomba's message.{02}{00}
We must fulfill our promise{03}to the Gabomba.{02}{00}
Then, maybe we can come back{03}inside this Gabomba statue{03}some other time to get it.{02}{00}
{11}{05} carried the message{03}of the Gabomba to Akafubu.{01}By the time {11}{05} finished{03}his story, dawn had broken.{02}{00}
It looks like just fixing the{03}channel should do the trick...{01}Maybe we need to look at{03}when the two magical charges{03}reach the statue in the middle.{02}{00}
By reaching this place, you{03}have proven your power.{02}{00}
By rights, Akafubu should bear{03}this power...{01}But I shall keep my promise{03}and bestow it upon the one{03}to reach this place first!{02}{00}
I am grateful for your promise...{01}But I am worried that we have{03}done Akafubu and the Kibombo{03}a great wrong.{02}{00}
Akafubu has not honed his own{03}powers, and the fault lies with{03}him alone...{01}And yet, there is a hint of{03}truth to what you say...{02}{00}
Then what are we to do?{03}Does this mean we won't{03}receive your magic?{02}{00}
As I have said, I will give{03}the power to you. Your{03}concern is misplaced.{02}{00}
But I must add some small{03}conditions to our agreement...{02}{00}
Wh-What kind of conditions?{02}{00}
You must not...mention{03}this to Akafubu.{02}{00}
Akafubu was plainly ill prepared{03}for this test. He will lose heart{03}if he hears what you have done.{01}And yet...the Kibombo have need{03}of this ill-prepared leader...{02}{00}
If Akafubu ever reaches this{03}place, I shall teach him the{03}magic as well.{01}Promise me that you will not{03}tell Akafubu that you earned{03}this magic. Can you do this?{02}{00}
Of course!{02}{00}
And now I shall sleep.{03}Farewell, successor to the{03}witch doctor.{02}{00}
Right... Well, I guess{03}that's that!{02}{00}
You are virtuous men,{03}coming here to deliver this{03}message. My son and I thank you.{02}{00}
What do we have{03}to be thankful of?{02}{00}
If they had just stopped me{03}from leaving the Great Gabomba,{03}this wouldn't have happened!{02}{00}
What!? If you had been more{03}interested in your duty, you{03}would not have left so quickly...{02}{00}
But, Father! These people are{03}trying to steal the magic of our{03}people! It should be mine!{02}{00}
Mine, I tell you! That power{03}belongs to me!{02}{00}
I'm going to be the one to{03}get the Great Gabomba's{03}magic! You'll see!{02}{00}
My son, you have much to learn.{03}He may look like a man, but{03}before me, he acts like a child.{02}{00}
See how he behaves when{03}he gets excited?{02}{00}
No matter what I say, he won't{03}listen to me right now.{02}{00}
I think that he has had{03}enough for today...{02}{00}
I see your point.{02}{00}
Well! I suppose we should{03}be leaving then.{02}{00}
After all, our journey has only{03}just begun. We cannot remain{03}idle much longer.{02}{00}
Dang! Why did I leave that{03}stupid room so quickly?{03}Stupid, stupid, stupid Akafubu!{02}{00}
After he became a witch{03}doctor, Akafubu had no more{03}reason to focus himself...{01}It is good that he now has a new{03}goal. He will have to work hard to{03}earn the Great Gabomba's magic.{02}{00}
I just can't quite grasp the{03}Great Gabomba's magic.{01}Still, I'm trying really hard{03}to help everyone, just like{03}the Great Gabomba said...{02}{00}
My son has been so kind{03}and compassionate since the{03}ceremony. He's a changed man.{01}He has focused on bettering{03}himself and earning the{03}Great Gabomba's magic.{02}{00}
Akafubu has finally completed{03}his ceremony, and things are{03}starting to calm down.{01}Maybe now, our warriors can{03}set aside their spears and{03}return to their peaceful lives.{02}{00}
It looks like there are fewer{03}warriors in Kibombo now, huh?{1E}{00}
All of our warriors were just{03}local farm boys...{01}Now that he's the witch doctor,{03}Akafubu let them all return{03}to their farming work.{02}{00}
You couldn't tell? I thought{03}you might have been a little{03}more observant, but oh well...{02}{00}
The Great Gabomba's mouth will{03}remain open until Akafubu has{03}earned the gift of the Gabomba.{01}Maybe I ought to sneak in there{03}and get a look around while I{03}have the chance.{02}{00}
Now that the ceremony is over,{03}I feel a touch depressed.{01}I wish we could have more big{03}events like that soon.{02}{00}
I couldn't for the life of me{03}figure out how our warriors{03}got to Indra without a boat.{01}But I just found out that{03}something has pushed Indra{03}into contact with Gondowan!{02}{00}
Oh... I smell something{03}delectable. We'll be eating{03}some good meat soon.{02}{00}
Good ol' meat... I love meat.{03}I can't wait until we get some.{02}{00}
We get to eat normal animals{03}again! They taste so much better{03}than those monsters we've had!{02}{00}
You didn't come to Kibombo{03}to get revenge on us for that{03}raid, did you?{1E}{00}
How many of you are there?{03}We've got some pretty{03}fierce warriors, you know...{01}You don't really think you{03}can defeat all of us, do you?{02}{00}
Whew! That's good to hear.{03}We're supposed to protect the{03}village, but I feel bad for the raid.{02}{00}
The other warriors are busy{03}hunting right now.{01}The food supply for the whole{03}village depends entirely on the{03}animals they catch.{02}{00}
Now that Akafubu is our new{03}witch doctor, we shall embark{03}on a path to peace.{01}The neighboring villages have{03}no reason to fear our warriors{03}any longer.{02}{00}
This is a signal fire. We use{03}these to send messages to{03}neighboring villages.{01}I hope these messages set{03}our neighbors' minds at ease.{02}{00}
Everyone was terribly worried{03}about Akafubu's ceremony.{03}We're all relieved it's over now.{02}{00}
Covering our warriors in paint{03}makes them scarier, and it makes{03}them more intimidating.{01}Most of our warriors aren't{03}that strong, so they need{03}every trick they can use.{02}{00}
I want to look inside the Great{03}Gabomba at least once.{01}You don't suppose just peeking{03}will get me cursed, do you?{02}{00}
Now that the witch doctor{03}ceremony is over, I've decided{03}that...it was kind of fun!{02}{00}
Because Kibombo lies hidden{03}deep in the continent, we rarely{03}hear news of the Eastern Sea.{02}{00}
You don't think anyone will notice{03}if I sneak a little nibble while I'm{03}cooking, do you?{02}{00}
Gulp! The smell of that sauce over{03}the fire is making me so hungry...{03}How long until we can eat!?{02}{00}
Lately the monsters have been{03}increasing, and the animals are{03}becoming more and more scarce.{01}That's why everyone's so{03}excited that we get to have{03}nice, normal steaks tonight!{02}{00}
No one in Kibombo really wants{03}war with our neighbors.{01}We want everyone who shares{03}this land to share peace as well.{02}{00}
With all our battles behind{03}us, we warriors spend our time{03}refilling the village food supply.{02}{00}
I wonder if I can keep going until{03}another village sees our signal{03}and comes to meet with us...{01}I don't care which village it is,{03}just send a delegation! Fast!{02}{00}
I have heard that if you head{03}west from southern Gondowan,{03}you'll see the Eastern Sea.{01}There are two continents{03}in the middle of that ocean:{03}Hesperia and Atteka.{02}{00}
Are you going to head{03}to western Gondowan?{1E}{00}
That's unfortunate. The recent{03}rains have swollen the rivers.{01}It is too dangerous for{03}us to allow anyone to pass.{02}{00}
That's for the best. It is far{03}too dangerous for anyone{03}to be going out west.{01}Perhaps a boat would lessen{03}the danger to a degree...{02}{00}
You can see Atteka from the{03}bridge in western Gondowan.{03}My grandfather told me so.{01}Someday, I'll be a warrior like my{03}grandfather, and I'll be able{03}to see it for myself!{02}{00}
I know I could find more animals{03}and grain on the far side of the{03}river. If only I could go...{01}These seasonal monsoon rains{03}have swollen the river and made{03}it too dangerous to cross.{02}{00}
Crossing the river by canoe{03}is much too dangerous.{03}I'd need a ship to get across.{02}{00}
If I'm ever going to be a warrior,{03}I must build more muscle and{03}master the art of the spear.{02}{00}
If you are looking for treasure,{03}look west of the river.{01}The rocky peaks there are{03}called the belly of the continent.{03}Great treasure hides there.{02}{00}
Each year, when the rains stop,{03}our warriors look for treasure{03}in the belly of the continent.{01}Maybe the belly is hidden, or{03}the treasure is also. I don't know,{03}but they all return empty-handed.{02}{00}
Sure, our legends speak of much{03}treasure, but no one ever seems{03}to have found it.{02}{00}
I wonder what Oeia meant when{03}he said that our magic is deeply{03}tied to the belly of the continent...{02}{00}
Oh, my back... It's been aching{03}ever since that ceremony.{01}I guess I really am too old{03}to dance the night away.{02}{00}
As soon as Akafubu became{03}our recognized witch doctor,{03}he became so much nicer.{02}{00}
I swear, that's the{03}last time I'll ever let{03}loose like that again!{02}{00}
Akafubu gets so grouchy.{03}I wonder if it's just his{03}frustration taking over...{02}{00}
Many in Gondowan fear the{03}might of the Kibombo warriors.{03}But we don't want to be feared.{01}Now is the time for Kibombo{03}to change its image.{02}{00}
We think it is time to inform{03}other villages that Akafubu{03}has completed the ceremony.{01}I think they'll be glad to know{03}that we no longer pose any{03}threat to them.{02}{00}
It won't be easy, convincing{03}them that we've turned over{03}a new leaf...but we'll try.{02}{00}
I am a mighty warrior, trained{03}from birth to be fierce. If you{03}are feared, you are powerful!{01}I'm...supposed to start my{03}"being nice to people" training{03}on Monday.{02}{00}
The weapons I sell in this shop are{03}ones we do not use in Kibombo.{01}You find it strange that I{03}do not sell the weapons{03}we make here, don't you?{02}{00}
Our warriors appear so strong{03}because of the deadly poison{03}on their spears.{01}In a war, Kibombo spears{03}would make a powerful ally.{02}{00}
The only defenses we Kibombo{03}need are our shields and our{03}war paint.{01}Our warriors think armor{03}is for cowards.{02}{00}
Because our paint is infused{03}with the witch doctor's magic,{03}we're safe from attacks.{01}I would opt for paint in any{03}battle...no matter how much{03}iron my enemy wore.{02}{00}
I'm sorry, but the Kibombo{03}spearhead poison is a tribal{03}secret, used for hunting only.{01}We can't let outsiders have{03}it, because they might try{03}to turn it toward evil uses.{02}{00}
If I had a coin for every time{03}some stranger came up and{03}asked me to sell them poison...{01}If only they'd let me sell it,{03}I could make millions!{02}{00}
Don't worry about the beds{03}here... We used to have insect{03}problems, but not anymore.{01}We use a special bug powder{03}on our beds. It's quite harmless{03}to humans, I'll bet.{02}{00}
I can't remember how long{03}it's been since we've had{03}any guests.{01}Tell you what... If you stay at{03}our inn, you can have all the{03}freshly grilled steak you want!{02}{00}
That bed makes me itch{03}so badly! It feels like bugs{03}are crawling all over me!{01}Whenever I get itchy, I just{03}rub some of that bug powder{03}all over myself!{02}{00}
I love Kibombo's famous{03}BBQ monster steak...with{03}extra-spicy Herb sauce!{01}It's a local treat that's fun{03}to eat! ...But it's not nearly{03}as fun catching the monsters...{02}{00}
Kibombo's peace is restored{03}now that the ceremony has{03}reached its end...{01}Now, the fate of Kibombo's{03}people depends on how{03}Akafubu leads them.{02}{00}
I can't believe that Akafubu{03}would change simply because{03}he completed the ceremony.{02}{00}
The mayor finally returned{03}from Alhafra.{02}{00}
Hey! It's you guys! It's good{03}to see you again!{01}You want to enter Madra?{03}Yeah, sure! Go ahead!{03}Feel free!{02}{00}
He was gone so long, I was{03}starting to worry that the{03}mayor would never come back.{02}{00}
How much longer do we{03}have to stand guard here?{01}Seriously, there's nothing to{03}guard against! We've already{03}been attacked by everyone!{02}{00}
I don't think the mayor ever{03}got that boat of his fixed,{03}either... Got tired of waiting.{01}I guess he's going back out again{03}as soon as he finds enough people{03}to fix it himself.{02}{00}
We go to all that work getting{03}the ship from Briggs, and now{03}we can't get it to work?{01}I guess the mayor's holding{03}a council to see if they can{03}figure out what's wrong.{02}{00}
I heard the boat the mayor got{03}is much better than the battered{03}raft we used to have!{01}I also heard that the new ship can{03}even sail far across the sea!{02}{00}
Is there by any chance a girl{03}named {11}{06} with you?{1E}{00}
Ah! Those people must have{03}been looking for you!{01}There were four of them, and{03}they looked weatherworn, but{03}they had an amazing ship.{02}{00}
Oh... Well, if you run across anyone{03}named {11}{06}, let her know{03}{11}{01} is looking for her.{01}You look like you travel a lot.{03}Maybe you'll run across this{03}{11}{06} somewhere.{02}{00}
Those travelers looked{03}worried about you.{01}You should find them, so that{03}they can know you are safe.{02}{00}
I wonder if the legends are{03}true... If there really is a great{03}society on a far-off island...{01}Because if they are true, I{03}want to see this island.{02}{00}
I don't know what will happen{03}when they all head out to sea.{03}They know nothing about sailing!{02}{00}
A group of sharp-looking{03}travelers came through{03}here recently.{01}They said they were looking for{03}an island called Lemuria.{02}{00}
If you have a big enough ship,{03}you can sail anywhere in the{03}world! Isn't that amazing?{02}{00}
I was at the mayor's house,{03}watching them argue about{03}why the boat won't move.{01}What's so important about{03}a mast, and what does it have{03}to do with sailing?{02}{00}
It's not that I don't want to go to{03}Alhafra... But what's the point if{03}we can't fix the mast?{02}{00}
The mayor asked me to go to{03}Alhafra with him, but I'm not{03}sure I should...{01}If that ship runs on the power{03}of the wind, how reliable could{03}it really be?{02}{00}
It seems no one is really happy{03}that the mayor got this grand,{03}new ship. The poor mayor...{02}{00}
Say, {11}{08}, there was{03}another group of travelers with{03}powers similar to your own.{01}What are the odds that we{03}should meet two groups{03}with these amazing abilities?{02}{00}
I thought Shin and the others{03}were lying, but after seeing{03}what I saw, I'd believe anything.{01}They called it Psynergy and said{03}it can change water into ice.{02}{00}
When {11}{01} and his party{03}heard about {11}{08}, they{03}seemed shocked.{01}They said they were going to{03}follow you to Gondowan.{02}{00}
Uhhhnnn... UHHHNNN!{02}{00}
They told me that you make{03}Psynergy by focusing your{03}mind...{01}I've been focusing nonstop{03}for days, but do you see{03}any ice? No!{02}{00}
How can anyone just create{03}ice by thinking about it?{01}I mean, imagine how much{03}power you'd have if you could{03}just think, and things happened!{02}{00}
Why would anyone be happy{03}to have a broken boat?{02}{00}
They've been having so many{03}meetings lately! I guess that{03}boat must be in miserable shape!{02}{00}
Everyone gets the urge to{03}explore, to go out into the{03}wild and see new lands...{01}I'd love to see the world. I'd{03}love to have an adventure{03}of my own!{02}{00}
I wonder why those travelers{03}were in such a hurry...{01}They looked so severe... You'd{03}think they carried the fate of{03}the world on their shoulders.{02}{00}
What was that island again?{03}Come on, brain... Work with me...{03}Lemoria? Lemurland? Lulu?{02}{00}
The people of Madra know our{03}own lands well...but we know{03}little of the world beyond.{01}What kind of fool would think{03}himself ready to sail into a{03}world he knew nothing about?{02}{00}
That island that group{03}was asking about sounded{03}familiar for some reason...{01}Grandpa used to tell me stories{03}about a treasure island when I{03}was young. Was that the place?{02}{00}
How big would a ship that{03}could go anywhere be?{03}Probably bigger than a whale!{02}{00}
Everyone here in Madra is afraid{03}of the Kibombo now. Do they{03}scare you, too?{1E}{00}
I saw the fear in your eyes{03}the instant I said "Kibombo."{03}Don't get worked up, though.{01}We caught sight of a Kibombo{03}smoke signal that said they had{03}given up their warlike ways.{02}{00}
You must have heard{03}their proclamation...{01}We only just caught sight{03}of their smoke signals... They{03}have announced a truce!{02}{00}
We're still recovering from{03}the Kibombo raid...{01}It's no small wonder people{03}are still afraid...{02}{00}
These new boats apparently{03}use the power of wind to cross{03}the seas...{01}I just don't understand how{03}a big pole in the boat can{03}help to capture the wind...{02}{00}
If a building has broken{03}columns, we tear it down...{01}Shouldn't a boat with a{03}broken column be torn{03}down as well?{02}{00}
Sailors are supposed to{03}use oars and pull the boat{03}through the water...{01}So, what's a sailor supposed{03}to do on a boat that's{03}powered by wind?{02}{00}
Our mayor's done so little for{03}us up until now... We should at{03}least thank him for the boat.{02}{00}
Is turning water to ice really{03}such a special power?{02}{00}
Madra is always so hot. If{03}there were some way to create{03}ice, it would be so...cool.{02}{00}
So, this {11}{08} fellow must{03}be a friend of {11}{01}...{01}Why else would they go all the{03}way to Gondowan for him?{02}{00}
I knew I should have asked{03}them how to make ice...{02}{00}
There's talk of mighty travelers{03}who passed by here recently.{03}I wish I could have met them.{01}It seems they had powers no one{03}has ever seen before. I bet those{03}powers could be profitable.{02}{00}
Since things are finally calming{03}down in Madra, our people are{03}ready to get down to business.{01}They seem to have thought up{03}a business plan that makes use{03}of {11}{01}'s power.{02}{00}
What if we just traveled with{03}{11}{01} to show off his powers...{03}We could make loads of cash!{02}{00}
The business plan our people{03}have come up with is supposed{03}to make us rich.{01}I guess it must be{03}a brilliant plan.{02}{00}
Our salesman said Kibombo's{03}ceremony is done, and he claims{03}that they're peaceful again.{01}I'll be so relieved if what he{03}said turns out to be true.{02}{00}
I wonder if the Kibombo have{03}truly set aside their spears{03}and returned to peace...{02}{00}
The continent shift makes it feel{03}like we're sharing backyards{03}with the Kibombo...{01}We'd be so happy if we could{03}live in peace without having to{03}fear their spears.{02}{00}
The salesman that just came back{03}from Gondowan claims the{03}Kibombo are peaceful now...{01}But if we relax, we won't be{03}ready for their next attack.{02}{00}
How are we to climb the cliffs{03}between here and Gondowan?{01}If someone would just drop{03}some ropes down from the{03}top, it wouldn't be a problem.{02}{00}
My husband relishes those rare{03}mushrooms growing in the{03}Gondowan cliffs.{01}I wish someone would{03}bring some back for him.{02}{00}
I'm dying for some of those{03}Gondowan mushrooms, but I{03}can't ever reach them.{02}{00}
My poor husband's getting old...{03}Those cliffs scare him now.{01}In his prime, he'd have{03}scrambled up those cliffs{03}in no time for a mushroom.{02}{00}
Oh, my... Is... Is that...{02}{00}
Is that one of his most{03}favorite mushrooms!?{02}{00}
Did you climb all the way up{03}those cliffs just to get that{03}mushroom for us?{02}{00}
That's the nicest thing anyone{03}has ever done for me. I have{03}to thank you for this!{02}{00}
But what could I have that a{03}warrior like you would want?{02}{00}
That's a tricky one...{02}{00}
I don't know if you want{03}a pet, but this is all we{03}can offer. Take care of it!{02}{00}
{10} got{03}{12}{01}!{02}{00}
I can't wait for dinner tonight.{03}Batter-fried mushrooms! Mmm!{02}{00}
This here's enough of a{03}mushroom that we'll be{03}eating it for days!{02}{00}
The more I think about dinner{03}tonight, the more I drool...{02}{00}
These mushrooms will make{03}any meal taste amazing!{02}{00}
No, dear... They look similar,{03}but these aren't quite right.{02}{00}
Thanks for bringing this by,{03}but it's just not the type of{03}mushroom we like...{02}{00}
Please... Won't you please{03}try to find the mushrooms{03}my husband loves so much?{02}{00}
That mushroom was great,{03}but I ate way too much. I{03}don't ever want to see it again!{02}{00}
Actually, I didn't cook the{03}mushrooms properly that night.{01}But, uh...please don't tell{03}my husband that.{02}{00}
I don't remember mushrooms{03}like that ever tasting bad...{02}{00}
If my husband finds out I{03}messed up the recipe, he'll{03}be so sad...{02}{00}
Same sailors came through{03}recently with a ship similar{03}to {11}{08}'s.{01}I'd never seen one before,{03}but now they're everywhere.{03}Are they new?{02}{00}
One of the sailors, {11}{01}, was{03}very curious about {11}{08}'s{03}ship. A little {09}{02}too{07} curious.{01}It looked like he had a{03}similar boat, almost identical{03}to {11}{08}'s.{02}{00}
Oars, I understand. Hey,{03}I'll even give a sailboat{03}a try...{01}But there's no way I'm setting{03}foot on a ship powered by{03}some fool magic thingie.{02}{00}
We've had a lot of strange{03}visitors ever since{03}{11}{08} showed up.{02}{00}
Have you by chance seen{03}a girl named Menardi?{1E}{00}
You have? And... And you're telling{03}me that my sister is...dead?{1E}{00}
If you continue these lies, I{03}might take it upon myself to{03}shut you up. Get out of my sight!{02}{00}
If you don't know my sister,{03}then I have nothing to say{03}to you. Get out of my sight!{02}{00}
Using Psynergy on me?{03}Are you so dense that you{03}don't know when to be afraid?{02}{00}
I don't have time to play{03}games with you. Now, leave{03}me to my thoughts!{02}{00}
Where could Menardi have{03}gone? Where are you, my{03}sister?{02}{00}
{11}{05}! You're back!{02}{00}
And you've brought{03}{11}{08} with you!{02}{00}
Oh! {11}{08}!{02}{00}
{11}{08}, I must apologize for{03}the trouble we've caused you.{03}I'm sorry we lost your jewel...{02}{00}
Don't be. Everything worked{03}out for the best.{02}{00}
{11}{08}, you said you were{03}going to go to Gondowan.{03}Did you make it?{02}{00}
Yes. In fact, we have{03}just returned.{02}{00}
And your jewel...{1E}{00}
You actually got it back from{03}the Kibombo? Incredible...{02}{00}
I was able to recover it{03}with the help of {11}{05}{03}and his friends.{02}{00}
That's wonderful! I'm so relieved!{03}I was worried that you might{03}never get it back!{02}{00}
You didn't recover it{03}from the Kibombo?{02}{00}
That's not true, sir. {11}{05}{03}and his companions helped{03}me recover it.{02}{00}
Please! Don't startle me like{03}that! I was afraid you might{03}never get it back!{02}{00}
That's why we came back...{03}To let you know that we've{03}recovered it. Worry no more.{02}{00}
Ah, so you'll be leaving{03}again, will you?{02}{00}
Are you sure you must leave{03}so soon, {11}{08}?{02}{00}
I may yet return here again, but{03}I'm afraid I must be going soon.{02}{00}
You seem to be quite busy.{02}{00}
It is their youth that allows{03}them to be so busy.{02}{00}
But we'll be back, I promise.{03}Maybe we'll be able to visit{03}at a more leisurely pace...{02}{00}
I'd like that...{02}{00}
So would I!{02}{00}
If you've already recovered{03}your jewel, why don't you{03}stay here for a bit longer?{02}{00}
Unfortunately, we can't...{02}{00}
Hey, have you seen{03}the girl out front?{02}{00}
We must go...to the island{03}that is my home.{02}{00}
{11}{08}, are you...{03}Are you sure?{02}{00}
After what we've been{03}through, I feel I've learned{03}a few things.{02}{00}
Like what!?{02}{00}
Like...the fact that you{03}truly are good people.{02}{00}
And that you have gone to{03}great lengths for no other{03}reason than to help those in need.{02}{00}
I have come to realize that{03}I, too, must do something{03}to help where I can.{02}{00}
{11}{08}...{02}{00}
I have made my decision.{02}{00}
And the sooner we depart,{03}the better, right, Kraden?{02}{00}
We shall set sail, {11}{05}!{03}To my ship! To the Eastern Sea!{02}{00}
Do you truly mean to leave{03}so soon, {11}{08}?{02}{00}
I may yet again have reason{03}to visit your town, but...{03}yes, I must go.{02}{00}
You seem quite busy.{02}{00}
It is their youth that allows{03}them to be so busy.{02}{00}
But we'll be back, I promise.{03}Maybe we'll be able to visit{03}at a more leisurely pace...{02}{00}
I'd like that...{02}{00}
So would I!{02}{00}
I know you went to a lot of trouble{03}to get us that boat, but we just{03}had to give up on it.{01}We couldn't just sit and wait in{03}Alhafra until the thing got fixed.{02}{00}
We just have to finish repairs{03}on that boat we left in Alhafra...{01}We've had several meetings{03}already, discussing our next{03}course of action.{02}{00}
I'm so relieved {11}{08}{03}got his jewel back.{02}{00}
I can't believe {11}{08}{03}actually went all the way to{03}Kibombo to get his jewel back.{01}That's so...dashing!{02}{00}
Gondowan is such an{03}awful, dangerous place...{01}I never imagined for a second{03}that {11}{08} would make{03}it back here safely.{02}{00}
I like you guys a lot. I'm{03}sad that you're leaving.{02}{00}
My daddy went to Gondowan,{03}and all I got was nothing.{02}{00}
All of this could have been avoided{03}if the people of Alhafra's offer to{03}repair the boat was genuine.{01}Now, I refuse to let that boat{03}fall into the hands of Alhafra{03}and its mayor.{02}{00}
Why won't the mayor of{03}Alhafra repair our boat?{01}If we could get that ship,{03}Madra would embark on a{03}voyage to prosperity...{02}{00}
I can't believe it... Despite all{03}my worrying, they got that{03}jewel back like it was nothing.{02}{00}
I felt a little responsible for{03}{11}{08} losing his jewel.{03}I'm so happy he got it back!{02}{00}
{11}{08} said he was going{03}to Gondowan alone, but now he{03}has some friends with him.{01}That's nice. If he'd been all{03}alone, I'm sure he would have{03}been eaten by monsters.{02}{00}
I wish they'd tell me all{03}about their adventures!{02}{00}
I'm so glad Daddy{03}got home safely.{02}{00}
{11}{05}, wait!{02}{00}
I believe I promised you{03}a reward for helping with{03}the boat, didn't I?{1E}{00}
Imagine! You came all this way{03}to put us at ease, and I totally{03}forget to give this to you!{02}{00}
Well, you may have forgotten,{03}{11}{05}, but I have not.{02}{00}
Regardless, I told you that I{03}would reward you when the{03}boat was fixed...{01}That may take quite a{03}while now, it seems...{02}{00}
That being the case, I'd like{03}to give you that reward now.{02}{00}
We can't accept it now,{03}though, could we, {11}{06}?{02}{00}
Madra is still in shambles{03}from the disaster... We couldn't{03}possibly accept any gifts...{02}{00}
Nonsense! Misfortune or no,{03}a promise is a promise!{02}{00}
{10} got{03}{14}{02}.{02}{00}
I am glad that I was able to{03}give it to you before you left.{02}{00}
Your travels seem to take you{03}from danger into greater{03}danger. Please be careful.{02}{00}
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.{02}{00}
...{11}{05}?{02}{00}
You... He just called you{03}{11}{05}, didn't he?{02}{00}
Why didn't I see it before?{03}You are {11}{05}!{02}{00}
Then Menardi should be{03}somewhere around here,{03}too... And yet...{02}{00}
You won't see Menardi or{03}Saturos ever again.{03}{11}{01} killed them.{01}They're probably at the bottom{03}of the sea by now...{02}{00}
{11}{07}! Quiet!{02}{00}
Hmph! I heard that, you{03}wretched little thing!{02}{00}
Can it be true? Is my{03}sister dead?{1E}{00}
No? Then where is she!?{03}Show me my sister!{02}{00}
What is the matter? Is it so{03}very hard? You were traveling{03}with her{B0}bring her to me!{02}{00}
She would never have left{03}you behind...and yet you are{03}alone...{05} So it's true? She's...{02}{00}
I can't believe it... No one has{03}the power to defeat Saturos{03}and my sister...{02}{00}
Yet you all avoid my gaze...{03}And that look on your faces...{03}It...is true...{02}{00}
Who is this {11}{01}?{02}{00}
What? You feign ignorance?{03}Why? Would you protect him{03}from my fury!?{02}{00}
Never mind. I believe I've heard{03}some rumors of a traveler{03}named {11}{01} lately.{02}{00}
Is this {11}{01} the same{03}one they've been speaking of?{03}Is he pursuing you?{02}{00}
If that is the case, then this{03}{11}{01} should show up{03}here sooner or later.{02}{00}
How do you know it wasn't{03}{11}{05} who defeated{03}your sister?{02}{00}
What do you take me for?{03}I'm a warrior, like my sister...{01}I can gauge a man's strength{03}at a single glance.{02}{00}
Even if you doubled {11}{05}'s{03}power, he would still be no{03}match for my sister.{02}{00}
And besides, I doubt {11}{05}{03}could find it in himself to{03}betray my sister.{02}{00}
He knows that the lives of{03}those he holds dear would{03}hang in the balance.{02}{00}
But I must congratulate you on{03}your successes at both the{03}Mercury and Venus Lighthouses.{02}{00}
Although your success there{03}now prevents us from{03}returning to the Western Sea.{02}{00}
You would have failed, of course,{03}had we not researched how to{03}climb those lighthouses...{02}{00}
Oh, didn't Menardi tell you?{02}{00}
Regardless, {11}{01} won't be{03}getting in my way.{02}{00}
You will have to find your own{03}way to the Western Sea.{02}{00}
And if you make the journey,{03}you'll have to light Jupiter on{03}your own as well!{02}{00}
We have our own work to do,{03}and number one on the list is{03}taking care of {11}{01}!{01}Are we clear on this, {11}{05}?{1E}{00}
Aren't you an obedient boy...{03}If you're worried you can't get{03}it done, we could help you a bit.{02}{00}
What's the matter? Afraid{03}you can't perform your duties?{03}We could help you a bit...{02}{00}
No, thank you. I believe we'll{03}just find Jupiter Lighthouse on{03}our own, if it's all the same.{02}{00}
I see. Just don't let{03}us down.{02}{00}
We're going to find{03}that {11}{01}...{02}{00}
I'm going to find this{03}{11}{01}...{01}And I swear that the last thing{03}he sees will be Karst avenging{03}the death of her dear sister!{02}{00}
Wow. And I thought Saturos{03}and Menardi had issues.{02}{00}
We shouldn't take Karst{03}too lightly...{02}{00}
Wait a moment... Karst did say{03}"we," didn't she?{02}{00}
Yes. Saturos and Menardi{03}traveled as a pair. Perhaps{03}she has a partner as well.{02}{00}
We ought to warn {11}{01}{03}that Karst is after him. Maybe{03}we should try to find him first.{02}{00}
Believe me, I'd love to see{03}{11}{01} again, but we just don't{03}have time to look for him. Plus...{02}{00}
Even if we did find them, I{03}think there is a good chance{03}we'd end up fighting them.{02}{00}
Why?{02}{00}
What we are trying to achieve,{03}they are trying to prevent...{03}And they will fight to stop us.{02}{00}
But, {11}{06}... Aren't you and{03}{11}{01} an item? Couldn't{03}you, you know, do something?{02}{00}
A... An item? No! I mean...{03}It's not like that! Not...really...{02}{00}
...Stupid {11}{07}...{02}{00}
Ah! Well! Er, yes. For now, we{03}should press onward to Jupiter{03}Lighthouse, like we'd planned.{02}{00}
But...what about {11}{02}{03}and the others?{02}{00}
Don't you mean...{11}{01}?{02}{00}
{11}{07}! Be quiet! Sheesh...{02}{00}
*Ahem!* Are you ready{03}to listen yet?{02}{00}
They were strong enough to{03}defeat Saturos and Menardi.{03}They won't be beaten easily.{02}{00}
We should continue on ahead,{03}just as Saturos and Menardi{03}would have, OK, {11}{06}?{02}{00}
{11}{07}? {11}{08}?{03}Are you ready?{02}{00}
Then we should be going,{03}right, {11}{05}?{02}{00}
Oh! {11}{08}! After the way{03}we treated you, I thought you'd{03}never come to Madra again!{01}I know we were not very nice{03}to you before... I hope you can{03}forgive us.{02}{00}
Shin's developed a terrible{03}fear of the cold. He's afraid of{03}being turned into a block of ice.{01}Tell {11}{08} to cool it{03}with the ice routine, OK?{02}{00}
Even the sound of the name{03}"{11}{08}" sends a chill{03}down my spine.{02}{00}
I understand why Shin's scared{03}of {11}{08}, but I think{03}he might be overdoing it.{02}{00}
It looks like the Kibombo must{03}have been involved in the raids{03}on our town...{01}Kibombo weapons are too{03}distinct... We found a bunch{03}of them after the attacks.{02}{00}
The pirates and the Kibombo{03}must have been working together.{03}What an astounding discovery!{02}{00}
People are saying the Champa{03}and the Kibombo formed an{03}alliance... I don't buy it, myself.{02}{00}
That night, the Champa came from{03}the east, and the Kibombo, from{03}the west. That's not an alliance.{02}{00}
My boyfriend, Shin, seems so{03}downtrodden lately...{03}I hope he's all right.{02}{00}
I've told my sister not to{03}worry about Shin. He's tough.{03}At least...he usually is...{02}{00}
Shin seems terrified of{03}{11}{08}. I wonder what{03}happened between them.{01}Still, I guess that explains{03}why he's been so on edge{03}lately.{02}{00}
Shin's normally so kind and{03}gentle. I hope he gets over{03}whatever's bothering him.{02}{00}
I've noticed lately that the{03}temperature of the ocean has{03}been slowly rising.{01}It is a bad omen, I say.{03}Be wary if you plan to{03}set sail soon.{02}{00}
The ocean's been warming up{03}a lot, and we're seeing lots of{03}dead fish washing up on shore.{01}At this rate, there aren't going{03}to be any fish left for us to{03}catch for food.{02}{00}
When the ocean warms, the{03}Eastern Sea beckons... Seek for{03}the center, the legends say.{01}These legends are known to{03}nearly every sailor. It would be{03}wise for you to remember it, too.{02}{00}
I knew the temperatures were{03}rising slowly over time...{01}But now, it's plain to see that{03}the temperatures are rising at{03}a dramatically higher rate.{02}{00}
Our new ship is spectacular, but{03}if we can't find some new fishing{03}spots, it does us no good at all.{01}Tidal waves, raids on our town,{03}and now the warming ocean{03}waters... What's going on?{02}{00}
Seafaring towns know many{03}more legends of the sea...{01}But a few of the sailors passing{03}through here have told their{03}share of stories of the salty sea.{02}{00}
Are you worried about all the{03}fish that have been washing{03}up dead on the shore?{1E}{00}
No need to worry. Those fish{03}all died farther out in the bay.{01}The fish we cook here at{03}the inn are caught fresh{03}from our pier.{02}{00}
No?! I suppose you'd be happy{03}if the fish up and vanished, huh?{01}They're dying because the ocean{03}temperatures are rising, but no{03}one is doing anything about it...{02}{00}
Has someone been telling you{03}that we've been serving up the{03}dead fish found on the beaches?{01}Outrageous! We go to great pains{03}to serve only the finest fresh{03}fish to our customers.{02}{00}
One of our guests kept asking{03}for a weapon that he could use{03}to slay a great sea monster...{01}He kept mentioning this trident{03}thing, but we couldn't help him.{02}{00}
I guess that a lot of dead{03}fish have been washing ashore{03}all over the eastern seacoast.{01}It's kind of sad... Imagine how{03}much money we could have{03}made if we'd caught them.{02}{00}
I've heard that rising ocean{03}temperatures mean that a{03}volcano is forming under the sea.{02}{00}
I've never seen a single customer{03}get sick from our fish! Not a{03}single one...{01}I've never served rotten old fish{03}in my life! I only use the finest,{03}freshest ingredients in my cuisine.{02}{00}
Someone must have seen me{03}burying the dead fish. I'll bet{03}that's where the rumor started.{02}{00}
It must be a very strange{03}monster if one needs such{03}a unique weapon to fight it.{02}{00}
If I had a boat we could{03}use, now would be a great{03}time to make some money.{01}We'd just need to take our{03}nets and scoop up whatever{03}we find...{02}{00}
Hm... I wonder if the tidal{03}wave might have been caused{03}by an undersea eruption...{02}{00}
My ship! At long last...{03}I have returned to my ship.{02}{00}
Well, {11}{08}?{02}{00}
I'm thrilled... I'm just happy{03}to be back with my ship.{02}{00}
Uh, that's not what{03}Kraden's asking...{02}{00}
You forgot, didn't you, {11}{08}?{03}When we talked in Kibombo?{03}Remember what Kraden asked?{02}{00}
He wanted you to take us{03}to your home... To Lemuria.{02}{00}
Remember how we said we'd{03}talk about it later?{03}Well, it's later now, {11}{08}.{02}{00}
Oh... Is it? I suppose we have{03}to talk about it sooner or later.{03}You shall have your answer.{02}{00}
{11}{08}...if you do not{03}wish to take us, you do not have{03}to. Just tell me honestly.{02}{00}
And if not, well, we'll just have{03}to get ourselves a boat and find{03}our own way to Lemuria.{02}{00}
Right, {11}{05}?{1E}{00}
What's with the guilt trip?{03}{11}{08} hasn't even given{03}us his answer yet!{02}{00}
Kraden! {11}{05}! Stop trying{03}to pressure {11}{08}!{02}{00}
{11}{07} is right! You guys{03}just let {11}{08} give{03}us his answer!{02}{00}
I agree with {11}{05}. We{03}shouldn't try to pressure{03}{11}{08}, Kraden.{02}{00}
But that's not what I was{B0}{02}{00}
Don't worry, {11}{07}...{03}I've actually been thinking{03}about this quite a bit.{02}{00}
I just never got the opportunity{03}to mention it before.{02}{00}
Well? Well!?{02}{00}
It's not nice to test the{03}patience of an old man.{03}Will you take us or not?{02}{00}
We will go to Lemuria, Kraden.{02}{00}
I figured it was too much to...{02}{00}
What did you just say!?{02}{00}
I will take you to Lemuria.{02}{00}
Kraden? Are you OK?{02}{00}
Is he OK!?{02}{00}
{11}{08}! Are you...{03}Are you serious?{02}{00}
After what we've been through,{03}it would be wrong to deny you.{03}That's what made up my mind.{02}{00}
What's what made up your mind?{02}{00}
The fact that you are{03}truly good people.{02}{00}
You have gone to great trouble{03}to help one whose problems{03}needn't have concerned you...{02}{00}
Witnessing that kindness...{03}It made me want to help, too.{02}{00}
{11}{08}, you...{02}{00}
No, {11}{06}. Please, don't say{03}a word. I've made up my mind.{02}{00}
I shall be leaving immediately,{03}but I want you to come, Kraden.{02}{00}
Let us set sail, {11}{05}!{03}To my ship! And the Eastern Sea!{02}{00}
So at long last, I will finally{03}reach Lemuria...{02}{00}
I wonder what kind of advanced{03}civilization we'll find in Lemuria...{02}{00}
I'm actually excited to find out!{02}{00}
What's wrong, {11}{08}?{02}{00}
It just occurred to me... The{03}mayor of Madra and his wife{03}must be worried about me.{01}I'd feel bad if I didn't let{03}them know I was all right{03}before leaving Indra.{02}{00}
We should go tell them that{03}I've retrieved my orb. Then{03}they wouldn't have to worry.{02}{00}
Is that acceptable, {11}{05}?{03}Can we stop by Madra briefly{03}before we leave for Lemuria?{02}{00}
What do you say, {11}{05}?{03}Shall we go see the mayor?{1E}{00}
Don't worry about me. I've waited{03}this long. I can wait a little longer.{03}Let's go see the mayor!{02}{00}
I have no objection, so why{03}not? Let's go.{02}{00}
But we must depart as soon{03}as we're done at the mayor's{03}house, {11}{08}.{02}{00}
Oh, thank you!{02}{00}
Then let's waste no time!{03}We should set out for{03}Madra at once!{02}{00}
At last, I'm back on my ship.{02}{00}
Finally, I can return to{03}my beloved Lemuria.{02}{00}
Wait there a moment.{02}{00}
To set sail, we must{03}go down to the power{03}chamber belowdecks.{02}{00}
Let's head down.{02}{00}
How did all these monsters{03}get on board? I could swear I{03}locked the door when I left...{02}{00}
It doesn't matter. Once we get{03}this ship moving, I'm sure they'll{03}all jump ship.{02}{00}
OK, now, I must set the{03}black orb in this pedestal.{02}{00}
Take the tiller, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
?!?{02}{00}
If you hope to reach Lemuria,{03}you'll have to learn a few{03}things about handling a ship.{01}I think we ought to sail{03}the Eastern Sea until you{03}get the hang of it.{02}{00}
Kraden, shouldn't we be heading{03}straight for Lemuria?{02}{00}
Well, I suppose if we have to{03}learn to sail, it's better to do{03}it sooner than later...{02}{00}
Then I want to go to Lalivero!{03}And Tolbi!{05} Oh! And Vale!{03}Can we go to Vale?{02}{00}
I'd love to see your hometown,{03}{11}{06}! Shall we? Let's{03}do it! To Vale we go!{1E}{00}
I don't think that's a good idea.{02}{00}
I'm with {11}{05}.{03}I don't think that would be{03}a wise course of action.{02}{00}
Come, now! Why not?{02}{00}
Think about the roads we have{03}traveled to get where we are...{02}{00}
I can't... I was never any{03}good at geography.{02}{00}
Then allow me to explain...{01}The coastline of Angara, the{03}continent in which Vale lies,{03}is surrounded by rocky cliffs.{02}{00}
Oh... You don't think {11}{08}'s{03}boat could land there?{02}{00}
And as for Gondowan, I would{03}guess the people from Lalivero{03}are...looking for us.{02}{00}
He's right. Saturos and Menardi{03}went a little wild in Lalivero,{03}and you were all with them.{02}{00}
Oh... But {11}{07} can explain{03}the situation for us.{01}Faran and the Laliverans{03}would understand, I'm sure.{02}{00}
And then they'd make me stay{03}in Lalivero! Would you just leave{03}me there, {11}{05}?{02}{00}
Oh yeah... Maybe that wouldn't be{03}such a good idea after all...{02}{00}
Then it's decided!{02}{00}
What's decided?{02}{00}
The sea is vast... We can go{03}wherever we please! So, let's{03}explore a bit, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
That's a great idea! We've{03}already met werewolves and{03}discovered new Psynergy.{01}I'm sure there's even more{03}out there waiting for us{03}to find it!{02}{00}
Wow! This is going to be great!{02}{00}
Hmm... The seas can be quite{03}dangerous. It won't be my fault{03}if something happens, Kraden.{02}{00}
To the open sea, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
There's no reaction...{03}It doesn't seem to be running.{02}{00}
The mayor tried to give {11}{05}{03}{14}{02}, but {11}{05} can't{03}carry any more items.{02}{00}
I couldn't possibly allow you to{03}leave with out giving you the{03}reward I promised.{02}{00}
The mayor put the {14}{01}{03}in a pot.{02}{00}
I'll put it in here. You can{03}come pick it up anytime.{02}{00}
Rocks are poking out above{03}the waves. Pass them with care...{02}{00}
These shoals would not make{03}a good place to land.{02}{00}
Ever since the tidal wave moved{03}Indra, we haven't been able to go{03}to Gondowan's western shores.{02}{00}
Did you know Indra moved?{03}It was quite a shock to all{03}of us here...{01}We haven't been able to use{03}the waterways to the south{03}ever since.{02}{00}
My pop's the best sailor in{03}all the Eastern Sea!{01}That's why he can go anywhere,{03}even in that tiny boat of his!{02}{00}
You're lucky, mister. You get to{03}ride your boat out on the open{03}sea all you want...{01}My dad'll be done with his boat{03}soon, and together, we'll be able{03}to sail anywhere we want...{02}{00}
The waterways north of Tundaria{03}would have been the perfect{03}place to teach my sons to sail...{02}{00}
I'm so grateful our little island{03}wasn't damaged in the tidal{03}wave... It was a miracle.{02}{00}
I can't wait until Dad teaches{03}me how to sail...{02}{00}
I can't wait until the day{03}I can sail far away with{03}Dad and Kirt...{02}{00}
Used to be, you could sail to{03}the other side of Gondowan by{03}skirting the coast of Tundaria.{01}Now, the whole area's got these{03}rocky spires... You just can't{03}work a boat around 'em.{02}{00}
You must be cold, dressed in{03}those thin clothes... Come warm{03}yourselves by the fire...{02}{00}
My mom says there's this{03}strange tower on the northern{03}cape of Tundaria.{02}{00}
Tundaria is the southernmost{03}continent in Weyard. I hear that{03}if you head east far enough...{01}There's an incredible waterfall{03}at the edge of the Easten Sea.{03}It sounds like hokum to me.{02}{00}
Around here, it doesn't matter{03}what season it is...{03}It's always the cold season.{01}I can't even go outside without{03}first covering myself in fur.{02}{00}
Who in Weyard would have{03}built a tower in the middle{03}of that frozen nowhere?{02}{00}
I just want to know what's on{03}the other side of that sea{03}of fog...{01}No one has ever crossed{03}through it, but one day, I just{03}know I'll do it!{02}{00}
The Sea of Time... A massive bank{03}of fog that lies over the sea... All{03}sailors fear it, and rightly so!{01}I don't know if I'll ever make it{03}through, but I'm certain my son{03}will do it someday.{02}{00}
Sailors tell of terrible currents{03}and vortexes that can tear a{03}boat to shreds in the Sea of Time.{02}{00}
When you enter the sea of fog...{03}enter the currents from the{03}direction of the red rocks.{01}Then, your ship won't be{03}destroyed.{05} But that's all I know.{03}And it might not even be right!{02}{00}
Ours is sad lineage...{01}Three generations of sons{03}have sworn their lives to trying{03}to pass through the sea of fog.{02}{00}
Dad and Grandpa haven't been{03}able to cross the Sea of Time.{03}They're so old now...{01}I will be the one to make{03}their dreams come true.{02}{00}
I remember once, an entire fleet{03}of ships entered the Sea of Time.{03}They vanished into the mists.{01}Every last one of the vessels{03}was destroyed by the currents.{02}{00}
Once, long ago, my husband{03}entered the Sea of Time{03}without being destroyed.{01}The whirlpools spun him around,{03}and he got so dizzy he couldn't{03}stand. I wonder if he remembers.{02}{00}
I didn't really discover the{03}secret of the red rocks...{01}It was Yepp, the great explorer{03}from Yallam, who told me.{03}I should fess up.{02}{00}
And just what will happen once{03}they get through the sea of fog?{03}I wish they would just give up.{02}{00}
We like this island. A lot...{03}That's why we're here...{03}Because we like it.{01}We sure aren't looking{03}for Treasure Isle! Nope!{02}{00}
What are you saying!? Idiot!{02}{00}
Don't listen to that guy. He{03}didn't say anything about{03}Treasure Isle. Nothing at all.{02}{00}
Look, we're busy...{03}We can't talk now...{03}Catch us some other time...{02}{00}
...{02}{00}
The Eastern Sea is huge, even{03}if you don't add the Sea of Time,{03}which I guess you've got to do.{02}{00}
You don't look like much of a{03}sailor. You're not a treasure{03}hunter, are you?{01}Because you won't find any{03}in the waters around here, let{03}me tell you!{02}{00}
If we're supposed to be partners{03}in this crazy treasure hunt, why{03}am I the one doing all the cooking?{02}{00}
Sure, there are legends about{03}how there's treasure hidden{03}north of the Sea of Time.{01}But have WE found any?{03}I just hope it's not on the sea-{03}floor! What would we do then?{02}{00}
You used to be able to dive{03}into the ocean and find all{03}sorts of treasure in the reefs.{01}I liked to think all that stuff{03}was a gift from the deep...{03}A gift for me!{02}{00}
The temperature of the ocean{03}has been rising. The waters{03}are hottest at the Sea of Time.{01}I sure hope Poseidon hasn't{03}surfaced again! He was once a{03}king, but now, he's a monster!{02}{00}
I remember how we used to{03}dredge up treasure by looking{03}for shadows in the reefs...{02}{00}
Long ago, Poseidon ruled{03}over all the oceans as the{03}one true king of the sea.{01}Legends say the only way to{03}defeat him is to stab him{03}with a trident...{02}{00}
Pen pen!{02}{00}
Pen pen pehnnn!{02}{00}
My darling Pengulina hurt{03}her leg on the far shore and{03}can't swim back.{01}Somebody, please... Help her!{02}{00}
Ohh... My leg... I can't get{03}back to my dearest Pengus...{02}{00}
Thank you so much for saving{03}my sweet Pengulina.{01}Allow me to give you this{03}in return for your help.{02}{00}
{11}{05} got a beautiful stone{03}from Pengus as a reward for{03}saving dear little Pengulina.{02}{00}
Pen pen.{02}{00}
Pen pen pehnnn.{02}{00}
I'm so happy my lovely{03}little Pengulina is all right.{02}{00}
I'm so glad to be back on{03}this side again, with my{03}precious Pengus.{02}{00}
Pen pen pen...{02}{00}
Pen pen pehnnnn.{02}{00}
There is nothing better than{03}spending a day playing in the{03}snow with my pretty Pengulina.{02}{00}
Pengus is pretty pleasant, and{03}I like that he likes me...{01}But he's always chasing me{03}around! I feel like I'm being{03}smothered...and I don't like it!{02}{00}
Chirp chirp!{02}{00}
I love feeling fancy! I want{03}a really fancy accessory{03}to make me feel extra fancy!{02}{00}
Oh my! That stone you have!{03}It's divine! Simply divine!{01}I must have it! MUST! I'll give{03}you my very fancy neckerchief{03}for that fancy stone of yours!{02}{00}
{11}{05} traded his stone{03}for the very fancy neckerchief.{02}{00}
Chirp chirp!{02}{00}
What do you think? Don't I{03}look fancy? I sure feel fancy!{03}And that's all that matters!{01}But I think this looks{03}fabulous on me! I love{03}fancy accessories!{02}{00}
Moo! Moo!{02}{00}
I've been feeling so low{03}lately... I long to feel the{03}utter joy of...something.{01}I just don't know what.{02}{00}
Oh! That red neckerchief{03}is quite nice indeed.{03}That would lift my spirits.{02}{00}
This really brightens{03}my mooood!{02}{00}
{11}{05} tied the neckerchief{03}to the tree.{02}{00}
Are you giving that lovely{03}thing to moooooi?{02}{00}
That's so kind of you! I should{03}repay you! Have some milk!{02}{00}
{11}{05} traded the red neckerchief{03}for some fresh milk.{02}{00}
Yup. A nice, red neckerchief{03}will never steer you wrong!{02}{00}
I'm sorry to hear that.{03}Come see me if you{03}don't want it anymore.{02}{00}
Are you giving that red{03}neckerchief to moooooi?{02}{00}
Arff! Arff!{02}{00}
The water here is so salty!{03}I wish someone would bring{03}me something tasty to drink.{02}{00}
Sniff! Sniff! I smell fresh milk!{02}{00}
Hah hah hah! Are you going{03}to give me that milk? Are{03}you? Huh? Huh!?{01}I'll trade you this for it!{03}I caught it myself!{02}{00}
{11}{05} traded his milk{03}for the dog's turtle!{02}{00}
I don't like to waste. I'll{03}just take little tiny laps.{02}{00}
I don't want to waste, so{03}I'm just taking little laps.{02}{00}
...{02}{00}
I'm so very...very lonely.{03}I could sure use a friend.{02}{00}
I'm so very sad and lonely.{03}I wish I had a friend to{03}call my own...{02}{00}
Hey! You've got an itty-{03}bitty turtle tot, don't you?{02}{00}
Why don't you set that{03}li'l guy free with me?{02}{00}
No? Oh... Then lonely I shall stay.{03}But if you change your mind,{03}you know where to find me.{02}{00}
Oh! You're really going to let{03}me take care of your li'l turtle?{02}{00}
At long last, I have a friend!{03}Lonesome George I am no more!{03}I'm so happy!{02}{00}
I don't have much to offer in{03}return, but I can show you...{03}my secret spot.{02}{00}
Hop on my back!{02}{00}
And we're off!{02}{00}
Well, here we are.{02}{00}
When you want to go back to{03}the island, just let me know.{02}{00}
Yup!{02}{00}
You all set to go back{03}to the island?{1E}{00}
Then back we go!{02}{00}
Here we are!{02}{00}
If you want to go to my secret{03}spot again, just let me know.{02}{00}
Take your time! I don't{03}like to rush...{02}{00}
Yup!{02}{00}
Want to go to my{03}secret spot again?{02}{00}
Anytime you want me to{03}take you to my secret spot,{03}just say the word.{02}{00}
Then hop on my back!{02}{00}
And we're off!{02}{00}
Well, here we are.{02}{00}
When you want to go back to{03}the island, just let me know.{02}{00}
Yup!{02}{00}
You all set to go back{03}to the island?{02}{00}
Then back we go!{02}{00}
Here we are!{02}{00}
If you want to go to my secret{03}spot again, just let me know.{02}{00}
Take your time! I don't{03}like to rush...{02}{00}
I am here to tend to any travelers{03}who come to this place.{02}{00}
May these travelers' journey{03}end in peace and safety...{02}{00}
Yallam doesn't get many{03}visitors. Hasn't for a long time.{01}I'd love to know a little about{03}what's going on in the outside{03}world.{02}{00}
Our master boatsman, Yepp, died.{03}Now, all we have to remember{03}him are the songs he wrote.{02}{00}
If Yepp were alive today, our{03}village would be thriving. He{03}brought us lots of work.{02}{00}
Yepp found this huge bed of pearls{03}and sold them in another town.{01}Then, he bought all kinds of{03}things we needed in Yallam.{02}{00}
There used to be a lot of{03}pearl divers here in Yallam. I{03}used to do some diving myself!{01}Yup... They were all younger{03}than me, but I still gave 'em{03}a good run for the money.{02}{00}
When we lost Yepp, all of{03}Yallam practically fell to pieces.{01}Our blacksmith, Sunshine, is our{03}only claim to fame now... He's{03}the best in all the lands...{02}{00}
Yepp was the one who taught{03}me how to handle a boat.{03}That was right before he died...{01}He'd promised to teach me{03}how to dive for pearls...{03}Poor Yepp. I really miss him.{02}{00}
Yepp told me the only thing{03}he could teach me was how{03}to sail and how to sing.{02}{00}
Yepp was the one who{03}visited the lands beyond{03}eastern Osenia.{01}Since he died, we've had{03}no news from the outside{03}world at all.{02}{00}
Singing with Yepp and all the{03}children in the village helped{03}us remember the songs.{01}It's funny how we all{03}memorized every one{03}of Yepp's songs.{02}{00}
Those pearls Yepp brought back{03}from the sea were the most{03}marvelous things I've ever seen.{01}If he were still with us,{03}Yallam wouldn't be in this{03}terrible fix.{02}{00}
Yepp never told any of{03}us where he found his{03}bed of pearls, but...{01}I suspect it's somewhere{03}near the center of the Eastern{03}Sea. He knew that area well.{02}{00}
Yepp was amazing. He could{03}cut clean through the Sea of{03}Time with utter ease.{01}He read those waves like no{03}other sailor on Weyard. He{03}was a true man of the sea.{02}{00}
Sunshine is a famous{03}blacksmith... The most{03}famous in Osenia...{02}{00}
I've searched the seas from{03}north to south, and I just can't{03}find those pearls...{01}I wonder if the pearls from his{03}secret place are all gone...{02}{00}
Yepp always sang such{03}wonderful children's songs{03}whenever he played with them.{02}{00}
Yepp had three different songs{03}he used to sing. Each song{03}was about a different situation.{02}{00}
Do you like children's songs?{1E}{00}
Hmmm... Well, I don't care for{03}them so much, myself.{01}I mean, the lyrics make no{03}sense! ...And that stupid dance{03}we have to do when we sing!!{02}{00}
Yeah, you're totally right.{03}I just hate those songs.{01}One of these days, I'll{03}write one, and it'll be so{03}much better than this!{02}{00}
The songs are supposed to mean{03}something, but none of the other{03}kids knows what...{02}{00}
I wonder why Yepp wanted{03}the children to learn those{03}songs he used to sing...{02}{00}
It's been really dry the past{03}few months. Even Taopo{03}Swamp has dried up.{02}{00}
We're supposed to be right in{03}the middle of the rainy season,{03}but I don't see any rain...{02}{00}
When Taopo Swamp dries up,{03}we're in for some serious{03}drought problems this year.{02}{00}
I can't stand this drought!{03}How long is the weather{03}going to be like this?{02}{00}
Sunshine has started complaining{03}that he can't work lately. He{03}blames it on the lack of rain.{02}{00}
Our blacksmith, Sunshine, makes{03}the kinds of items you can't{03}find anywhere else.{01}You wouldn't know it to look{03}at him...or to talk to him...but{03}he's an amazing worker...{02}{00}
What kind of person only wants{03}to work when it's raining?{01}I know Sunshine likes to enjoy{03}his days off, but he needs to{03}find a better excuse not to work.{02}{00}
Sunshine's a little eccentric. He{03}disappears into Taopo Swamp{03}for days at a time...{02}{00}
If the blacksmith isn't willing to{03}work, then how am I supposed{03}to get fine weapons to sell?{02}{00}
If Sunshine set his mind to it,{03}he could make a lot of money!{03}What a waste of talent...{02}{00}
If you want plain old, boring{03}armor, have a look around.{01}If you're looking for some{03}of Sunshine's work, you'll{03}have to come back later.{02}{00}
I shouldn't tell him how boring{03}all this stuff is. I wish Sunshine{03}would get back to work!{02}{00}
If you're looking for Taopo{03}Swamp, head west around{03}the northern mountain range.{01}Sunshine sometimes goes{03}up there by himself on long{03}trips. It's a dangerous place.{02}{00}
What does Sunshine want{03}in Taopo Swamp?{01}There's nothing up there{03}but bugs and some odd{03}mountain fish.{02}{00}
It's a bit strange trying to{03}run an inn in a city that{03}never gets tourists, isn't it?{01}Well, sometimes, the locals{03}like to stay here. It's like a{03}little vacation for them, I guess.{02}{00}
Taopo Swamp has dried up, and{03}now it's inaccessible.{01}What's worse, with no water,{03}we can no longer get any more{03}delicious Yallam mountain fish.{02}{00}
Yallam was always such a{03}poor town. We had to work{03}hard just to break even.{02}{00}
There weren't a lot of mountain{03}fish after the swamp dried up.{03}We probably won't catch many.{02}{00}
Even out in these far-off{03}shores, people need the{03}services and hope I bring.{01}I am grateful merely to have{03}the chance to bring them{03}some small relief.{02}{00}
Once, this was a thriving village.{03}Now, I look around, and I only{03}see abject poverty and despair.{02}{00}
Ah, so you want me to make{03}you a little something special?{1E}{00}
Listen, when the sun's shining,{03}that's "me time." I only work{03}when it's raining, you get me?{02}{00}
Oh, that's good. It's a bright,{03}sunshiny day, so I'm not doing{03}any work. Not till it rains.{01}But listen, I'm not just slacking{03}off because it's a nice day. I can{03}only work in the rain! Really!{02}{00}
This is Sunshine's house. He's the{03}local blacksmith.{01}I'm afraid he's not taking on{03}any jobs right now, though.{03}He's just not...{02}{00}
Dad's not doing any work right{03}now, but I'm making some basic{03}things for the villagers.{01}Maybe someday, I'll be able to{03}smith unique weapons, like my{03}dad. That's why I keep practicing!{02}{00}
If it's not raining, I can't get{03}into Taopo Swamp.{01}And if I can't get to Taopo, then{03}I can't get the stuff I need to{03}work, so there's no point!{02}{00}
Sunshine's a pretty stubborn guy.{03}If he says he isn't going to{03}work, then he's not gonna work.{02}{00}
Everyone thinks Dad is stubborn,{03}but he's not...{01}He's a true artist, and so what{03}if he gets a little temperamental{03}from time to time?{02}{00}
Hey, where did you get your{03}hands on those materials?{02}{00}
Well, it doesn't really{03}matter, now does it?{02}{00}
Looking at those raw materials{03}you've got there gives me a{03}mean hunger to do some smithing!{02}{00}
I handed him the {14}{01}.{02}{00}
Wait until you see what I'm{03}going to make for you!{03}You'll be amazed. Seriously.{02}{00}
I can't wait to see what I'm{03}going to wind up making with{03}this...{01}It's funny, but I never know{03}until I actually start working! I'm{03}sure you'll be happy with it!{02}{00}
It takes our Sunshine a long{03}time to finish the items he{03}works on.{01}Maybe you could just...wait{03}a little while before coming{03}to pick it up...{02}{00}
It's so weird, but something{03}really inspired my father to{03}work! He's beaming with joy!{02}{00}
It's been a long time since{03}I've been able to work. I'm so{03}excited! What should I make?{02}{00}
What happened to Sunshine?{03}He's so happy, and he just{03}talks about work all the time!{02}{00}
Now that my dad's working again,{03}I have to watch his every move{03}to see what I can learn from him.{02}{00}
You want the item I made{03}with your raw materials?{03}Sure, sure...{01}My wife has it. She can{03}give it to you.{02}{00}
I've got the item you ordered.{01}Now, about the payment... We{03}only take cash. I hope that's not{03}a problem. Do you have enough?{1E}{00}
Hey, we're not a charity! If{03}you don't have the money,{03}you don't get the item!{02}{00}
Right. Your {14}{01} will{03}come to {12}{01} coin{19}.{02}{00}
Hey, you don't enough money!{03}What are you trying to pull!?{03}I can't give you this!{02}{00}
OK, here you go!{02}{00}
You got the {14}{01}!{02}{00}
Man, if Sunshine worked more,{03}we'd be wealthy! What a{03}waste of a great talent...{02}{00}
My dad's work is just insane!{03}It'll take me years to be{03}that good!{02}{00}
Do you want to hear one of{03}the songs Yepp wrote?{1E}{00}
This is where all the kids{03}in Yallam come to play...{01}Nobody complains when we{03}play around out here...{02}{00}
Running around in circles{03}here while singing one of{03}Yepp's songs is pretty tough.{02}{00}
There's a game that goes along{03}with the song, but it's tough. I{03}want to play something else.{02}{00}
Yepp wrote all of his children's{03}songs while he was out here{03}in his own private space.{02}{00}
Yepp's songs are a lot of fun,{03}because he made this game{03}that goes along with them...{02}{00}
There's a lot of stuff to remember{03}for each song. It's tough to play{03}without making any mistakes.{02}{00}
I once heard that children's{03}songs and stories have{03}hidden meanings.{01}I wonder if Yepp has hidden{03}anything in his songs...{02}{00}
The story is that all these objects{03}around here were brought here{03}by Yepp long, long ago.{01}If you look around, you'll see{03}that everything was arranged{03}in accordance with his songs...{02}{00}
Here, let me show you!{02}{00}
Try turning the wooden pole{03}sticking out of that stone.{02}{00}
I thought I saw something{03}sparkling in the ground!{02}{00}
Hey, why don't you play with{03}us while we sing Yepp's song!{02}{00}
This is where all the kids{03}in Yallam come to play...{01}Nobody complains when we{03}play around out here...{02}{00}
Running in circles and singing{03}that song makes me feel all{03}dizzy in the head.{02}{00}
There's a game that goes along{03}with the song, but it's tough. I{03}want to play something else.{02}{00}
Yepp wrote all of his children's{03}songs while he was out here{03}in his own private space.{02}{00}

Here, let me show you!{02}{00}
If you want to go to the stars,{03}if you want to go to the stars.{02}{00}
Go north past the twins,{03}passing two swirls, run{03}deasil twice 'round the trunk.{02}{00}
Haste without waste, and head to{03}the east, past three to the north.{02}{00}
There, run 'round thrice and wait{03}for the waves. When they stop,{03}run north and go to the stars.{02}{00}
If you race full of folly and{03}take the wrong way, you'll{03}find yourself a watery grave.{02}{00}
Do you wanna hear the second{03}children's song Yepp wrote?{1E}{00}
Well, that's just fine then. Give{03}me a holler if you ever do.{02}{00}
If you want to go to the moon,{03}if you want to go to the moon.{02}{00}
Face west from the stars and{03}run straight past three swirls,{03}then circle 'round twice.{02}{00}
Haste without waste, and head to{03}the south, then one swirl west.{02}{00}
There, run 'round thrice and wait{03}for the waves. When they stop,{03}run south and go for the moon.{02}{00}
If you race full of folly and{03}take the wrong way, you'll{03}find yourself a watery grave.{02}{00}
OK, so, now do you want to{03}hear the third children's song?{1E}{00}
Well, that's just fine then. Give{03}me a holler if you ever do.{02}{00}
If you want to go to the sun,{03}if you want to go to the sun.{02}{00}
Face south from the moon{03}and run straight through two{03}swirls, then circle 'round twice.{02}{00}
Haste without waste, and head to{03}the west, then six to the north.{02}{00}
There, run 'round thrice and wait{03}for the waves. When they stop,{03}run north and go for the sun.{02}{00}
If you race full of folly and{03}take the wrong way, you'll{03}find yourself a watery grave.{02}{00}
That's it. That's all the games{03}we have for the songs...{01}If you want to play some{03}more, just give me a holler.{02}{00}
This is Apojii, the easternmost{03}island in the Eastern Sea!{01}Wherever you're from, you've{03}come a long way. You must{03}be here to see Gaia Falls!{02}{00}
Whatever you do, don't sail{03}out to the eastern edge{03}of the sea...{01}That's where the world ends.{03}No one knows where the falls{03}go, but you won't come back!{02}{00}
The huge waterfall at the{03}edge of the world is known{03}as Gaia Falls.{02}{00}
On Aqua Island, you can see{03}the guardian moai.{01}Because of the moai, no one{03}can climb the craggy mountain.{02}{00}
Have you any idea what it's like{03}living on the edge of the world?{03}One wrong step, and down you go!{02}{00}
I don't know what brings you{03}to Apojii, but you'd better not{03}be planning anything stupid.{02}{00}
When they come of age,{03}all the men of Apojii go{03}to Aqua Island. Will I, too?{02}{00}
Do you think if you fall off{03}of Gaia Falls that you keep{03}on falling forever and ever?{02}{00}
If there's nothing on Aqua{03}Island, then what are those{03}moai guarding, anyway?{02}{00}
Looking over Gaia Falls{03}really makes you feel{03}small and insignificant.{02}{00}
The currents near Apojii run{03}swiftly because we're so near{03}to Gaia Falls.{02}{00}
All of the ocean's water is{03}spilling over Gaia Falls... Where{03}does it all go?{01}And more importantly, what{03}happens when all the water's{03}gone over the edge?{02}{00}
Why would anyone build{03}a guardian statue out on{03}Aqua Island? What's to guard?{02}{00}
Well, at least Gaia Falls will{03}put an end to a few silly{03}arguments.{01}After all, if it's got an edge{03}and you can fall off it, the{03}world is clearly FLAT!{02}{00}
Apojii has so many nice{03}sights... Gaia Falls to the east,{03}and Aqua Island to the south.{02}{00}
Aqua Island is supposed to{03}be dangerous, but that's why{03}I want to go!{02}{00}
I wonder where I'd be if I{03}fell off Gaia Falls...{01}I'd like to know, but I don't{03}want to find out firsthand!{02}{00}
Aqua Rock must be the secret{03}hidden on Aqua Island. One day,{03}I'll have to scale its peak.{02}{00}
What...{03}What just happened?{02}{00}
That rock couldn't have heard{03}my wishes... That's impossible!{02}{00}
It's got to be.{02}{00}
Well, OK then... Maybe we should{03}try putting some more of our{03}wishes into the rock.{02}{00}
There's this guy in town who{03}spends his time at the spring,{03}staring at the Aqua Stone.{02}{00}
Why does my father keep{03}staring at that rock every day?{02}{00}
I just wish he'd spend{03}some time at home. I'm{03}fed up with his nonsense!{02}{00}
I can't ever tell what kind{03}of mood Mom and Dad are{03}in. At least they're not fighting.{02}{00}
I absolutely refuse to let{03}my son swim in the ocean{03}until he is an adult.{02}{00}
The currents around Apojii{03}are just too strong to let{03}children swim on their own.{01}They're too strong for a lot{03}of the adults, too... They can{03}just wash a person away!{02}{00}
I'm not allowed to go{03}into the ocean.{02}{00}
Hey, mister! Did you know{03}that all the kids are calling{03}you their hero?{02}{00}
I sink like a rock. It always{03}embarrasses my son to see{03}me try to swim.{01}I'm afraid he's no better than{03}I am, but he still wants to{03}practice and get better!{02}{00}
Poor boy... His father sinks like{03}a rock, and I know it's genetic.{03}So he's not allowed to swim!{02}{00}
It's stupid that I'm not{03}allowed to swim just because{03}Dad doesn't know how...{01}Someday, I'll show him...{03}I'll show them all!{02}{00}
Wow! He swam in the ocean{03}and survived the currents!{03}And he's looking at me!{02}{00}
That old Aqua Stone is{03}supposed to be the key to{03}getting onto Aqua Island.{02}{00}
He's too old to try now,{03}but my husband used to{03}dream of scaling Aqua Rock.{02}{00}
You unlock the Aqua Stone by{03}making it damp, but splashing{03}springwater on it won't work.{02}{00}
He always wanted to climb{03}to the peak of the mountain{03}on Aqua Island.{01}But he spent all his time{03}studying that Aqua Stone{03}instead. I always wondered why.{02}{00}
It'd be nice if we could{03}import some items that{03}our visitors would like.{02}{00}
No one ships to Garapas so{03}I wonder if wares are scarce.{01}On the other hand, I suppose some{03}wares are unique to Garapas.{02}{00}
Wow! You look just like the guy{03}who showed up in the fancy boat.{01}He slept for a long time... He{03}must've had a really long trip.{02}{00}
You guys aren't the warriors{03}who came in that boat, are you?{1E}{00}
Hmm... A while ago, some{03}others came in a boat much{03}like yours...{01}I'm sure back on the mainland{03}that those boats are all very{03}popular, aren't they?{02}{00}
It's not nice to tease an old{03}lady! If that's not your boat,{03}then how did you get here?{02}{00}
I'm sure that boat is{03}quite comfortable...{01}But no matter how nice your{03}boat is, you can't beat sleeping{03}in a nice, dry bed on land.{02}{00}
Those guys on the other{03}boat must have been pretty{03}well off...{02}{00}
This little island must seem{03}quite boring to you{03}sophisticated mainlander types.{01}But we have our share of{03}hardships and trials.{02}{00}
I'm sick of living on this{03}boring island paradise!{01}Ah! Does thinking that{03}make me a bad person?{02}{00}
I'd love to go to the mainland.{03}I want to go somewhere{03}without any ocean!{02}{00}
Whenever visitors come{03}out, the islanders start to{03}complain about their lives.{01}But they don't realize that{03}they live better here than{03}they ever could in Osenia.{02}{00}
Maybe they'll take me with{03}them if I ask for a job! I can{03}swab a mean deck!{02}{00}
I wonder what it's like,{03}standing in the middle of a{03}vast ocean of grass or sand.{02}{00}
{10} checked the tablet.{03}It looks like there are strange{03}characters carved on it.{01}Wielder of Water's strength...{03}Lay your hands upon this stone.{01}If th'art worthy, the power{03}to drain away the standing{03}water shall be yours.{02}{00}
Water's strength, huh? That sounds{03}like my sort of thing, doesn't it?{02}{00}
{11}{08} tried to touch{03}the stone slate.{02}{00}
What went wrong? What are{03}we going to do, {11}{05}?{02}{00}
Maybe our power{03}is being tested.{02}{00}
{10} checked the column.{01}{00}
It's a column with a spot where{03}you can place something.{02}{00}
You placed the {14}{01}.{02}{00}
We've had a lot of trouble{03}here in Izumo lately.{01}I don't want to scare you,{03}but...you should leave, and fast.{03}Right now. Seriously. Run.{02}{00}
My name's Okuni. I'm a great{03}dancer... Except I don't feel{03}much like dancing these days.{02}{00}
Lady Uzume doesn't want{03}to sacrifice Kushinada.{01}But that's the only way{03}to appease the serpent...{02}{00}
Susa's going to try to kill the{03}serpent and save his beloved{03}Kushinada. He's so fearless!{02}{00}
As a child, Susa was as wild as{03}could be and brought his elder{03}sibling, Lady Uzume, much strife.{01}Kushinada is the one who tamed{03}his wild ways. Of course, no one{03}wants to see her sacrificed.{02}{00}
Choosing the next sacrifice{03}by lottery seems such a{03}harsh method.{01}I am far too old to understand{03}the ideas of these modern times.{03}They seem far too extreme.{02}{00}
The daughters of the family in{03}that home requested that we use{03}a lottery to choose the victims.{02}{00}
A brave warrior will appear to{03}defeat the serpent by the next{03}full moon...{01}It's just a legend, though. No one{03}believes that. No one.{02}{00}
See this ring of giant stones?{03}They've been here for ages.{03}No one knows who put them here.{01}See how they make{03}this beautiful circle?{03}Except for that one, right?{1E}{00}
Susa moved it... He didn't even{03}use his hands. He surely holds{03}the secrets to a great power.{02}{00}
You're...not terribly{03}observant, are you?{02}{00}
The misaligned stone! It's{03}back in its original position!{03}How did this happen!?{02}{00}
Hmmm... Either Susa or Kushinada{03}must have moved it when{03}I wasn't looking.{02}{00}
Can you imagine what it must{03}be like to have the power to move{03}stones without touching them?{01}That anyone should possess{03}that power is truly amazing.{02}{00}
The Great Serpent of Mikage{03}has awakened... What does it all{03}mean?{01}That dragon is the guardian of{03}the island, so why is it treating{03}us so cruelly?{02}{00}
I'm not going to be sacrificed,{03}but that doesn't mean I'm happy.{01}My dear friend Kushinada{03}doesn't deserve this, either...{02}{00}
I'm sure that kindhearted{03}Lady Uzume doesn't want{03}to sacrifice anyone.{02}{00}
What if losing Kushinada makes{03}Susa return to his wild ways?{03}I hope he fights the serpent...{01}If he loses, at least he won't{03}have to bear living without{03}Kushinada.{02}{00}
Lady Uzume loves her brother{03}dearly... I'm sure she'd take{03}Kushinada's place if she could.{02}{00}
Sacrifices as great as this{03}should not be determined by{03}chance alone...{02}{00}
Kushinada's always had bad{03}luck at games of chance. I'll bet{03}those girls were counting on it.{02}{00}
Why won't anybody listen{03}to Lady Uzume?{01}They've always trusted her,{03}at least up until now...{02}{00}
Why does Lady Uzume have{03}me guarding these ruins?{03}What a waste of time...{02}{00}
Okuni, Kushinada, and Lady Uzume{03}all drew in the lottery to choose{03}the next sacrifice with us...{01}I can't believe we drew{03}Kushinada. Is that chance? Fate?{03}I guess you never know...{02}{00}
If Lady Uzume's name had been{03}drawn in the lottery, would she{03}have been the next sacrifice?{02}{00}
I'm so relieved that I'm not{03}this year's sacrifice, but what{03}happens next year?{02}{00}
Susa's been so sad all the{03}time, ever since Kushinada{03}was named the next sacrifice.{01}I never liked the old, wild Susa,{03}but he's so different now. Maybe{03}I can be his new girlfriend.{02}{00}
Lady Uzume's been able to focus{03}on governing Izumo lately. I think{03}it's because Susa's calmed down.{02}{00}
I only suggested this lottery{03}idea because I didn't want to{03}be sacrificed.{01}It looks like Kushinada really{03}does have bad luck, like{03}everyone says...{02}{00}
What I want to know is, what{03}caused our legendary guardian{03}to awaken?{02}{00}
A while back, a volcano erupted{03}on the mainland. We saw brilliant{03}flashes of light to the west.{01}The great dragon awoke shortly{03}afterward. It caused a terrible{03}panic through the island.{02}{00}
That Dragonsbane seems to{03}have put the serpent under...{03}but for how long?{02}{00}
I can't find my dagger...{03}I had it earlier... Where did it{B0}{03}I wonder if Susa...{02}{00}
I am old, and I've had enough of{03}this world. Why wouldn't I make{03}a good sacrifice for the dragon?{02}{00}
The serpent can't stand sunlight,{03}so it only shows up in the village{03}at night. Just as the legend says.{02}{00}
The serpent is only supposed{03}to awaken if the island is in{03}grave danger.{01}I wonder what calamity{03}is going to befall us...{02}{00}
I wonder if all the recent{03}disasters aroused the dragon{03}from his slumber on the mountain.{02}{00}
The serpent will drink as much{03}Dragonsbane as it can find,{03}right down to the last drop.{01}Nobody knows why they like{03}it so much, considering how{03}much it weakens them...{01}It must be like catnip to them.{02}{00}
According to legend, that's the{03}only thing that can put the{03}serpent back to sleep.{01}As for the dagger...{03}I'll bet Susa's planning on{03}using it to save Kushinada.{02}{00}
Our guardian serpent is really{03}just a dragon. Why do dragons{03}always want maiden sacrifices?{02}{00}
There's no way to get sunlight{03}into the serpent's cave on{03}Mt. Mikage. Just no way...{02}{00}
Yeah, Susa came through{03}here on his way to save{03}Kushinada.{01}The jerk knocked me flat{03}and just kept on going...{03}He was totally wild...{02}{00}
Even if Susa tried to rescue{03}Kushinada, she wouldn't just{03}run away with him.{01}I think she still believes that{03}a hero will appear and defeat{03}the serpent. That must be it.{02}{00}
You know, I can't stand Susa,{03}but I understand how he feels.{03}Kushinada's a really sweet girl.{02}{00}
Lady Uzume says that a hero{03}would appear, but I don't know...{03}There's no hero coming...{01}If Susa came running past{03}me with Kushinada, I wouldn't{03}stop them.{02}{00}
*Sniff*{02}{00}
Susa, don't come{03}for me...{02}{00}
If I see you, I'll surely lose{03}the courage to sacrifice{03}myself for Izumo.{02}{00}
If I run, Lady Uzume and all{03}of Izumo will suffer greatly...{03}Please... Don't come for me.{02}{00}
Lady Uzume has foretold{03}the coming of a hero,{03}and I believe her...{02}{00}
And so I shall remain here,{03}until the coming of the next{03}full moon...{05}and the hero.{02}{00}
Susa, please...{03}Don't try to save me.{02}{00}
Susa's not here. I believe{03}he went to Mt. Mikage.{02}{00}
He believes he can save{03}Kushinada, and so he has{03}gone to fight the serpent.{02}{00}
He truly believes he can{03}defeat the Great Serpent{03}of Mikage.{02}{00}
It's all for naught, though, as{03}a hero will certainly appear and{03}destroy the great serpent.{02}{00}
If the serpent defeats Susa,{03}I'll...be alone.{02}{00}
There's no point dancing{03}if Okuni's not here...{02}{00}
The serpent attacked the{03}town one night during a{03}festival.{01}It didn't leave until it had{03}eaten all of the food we'd{03}prepared for our feast...{02}{00}
The serpent ate all our food{03}and vanished into the darkness.{03}It ruined the festival.{02}{00}
The serpent lives on Mt. Mikage.{03}In our tongue, its original name{03}meant "the undying mountain."{01}As long as the serpent{03}lives on its peak, I doubt the{03}serpent will ever die, either.{02}{00}
I pray that our guardian's{03}anger is not aroused and{03}that Susa will be protected...{02}{00}
Okuni's such a great dancer.{03}It's just so much more fun when{03}she's here to dance with us.{02}{00}
The serpent would eat up{03}anything we put in front of{03}it! Its hunger knows no bounds.{02}{00}
Before the serpent ate all{03}our food, it was a terror{03}to behold...{01}But afterwards?{03}He wasn't so bad.{01}No doubt about it, that{03}serpent sure knows good{03}food when he eats it.{02}{00}
Legend has it that Mt. Mikage{03}is enshrouded by a mysterious{03}power.{01}I wonder if that's the source{03}of the serpent's eternal life.{02}{00}
Izumo's leaders have always{03}possessed certain special{03}powers. Always.{01}And let me tell you, the{03}combined power of Susa and{03}Lady Uzume is stunning to see.{02}{00}
One day, Kushinada put on{03}a display of power so great{03}that it almost rivaled Susa's!{01}It's such a shame...{03}I really wanted to see how{03}strong she might have become.{02}{00}
The power that Lady Uzume{03}and Susa possess comes{03}from their ancestors.{01}It cannot be learned, and it{03}cannot be imitated.{02}{00}
It was the day those bright rocks{03}fell from the sky... That's when{03}Kushinada gained her powers.{02}{00}
Of course, I knew the legend of{03}the great serpent... Everyone{03}does! But I didn't believe it!{01}Sacrificing a young girl to the{03}serpent year after year?{03}It's too cruel to be true!{02}{00}
If I were younger, I might{03}have been the sacrifice...{03}Ahh... It's so horrible!{02}{00}
Things like this are really{03}going to hurt the inn... We get{03}few enough travelers as it is!{02}{00}
What does that serpent plan{03}on doing with those young{03}women?{01}Surely, it doesn't intend{03}to marry all of them!{02}{00}
Why would our guardian{03}spirit demand a sacrifice?{03}It's inexcusable!{01}A true guardian would never{03}require such a cruel tribute.{02}{00}
*Sniff* How could we{03}sacrifice our beloved{03}Kushinada? It's not fair!{02}{00}
When I get older, I might{03}have to be a sacrifice, too...{03}...What's a sacrifice?{02}{00}
If only I possessed the power{03}to prevent this from happening.{03}Please grant me strength...{02}{00}
I don't want the serpent of{03}Mt. Mikage to eat Kushinada.{03}Oh, won't somebody help her?{02}{00}
Nobody wants to be a sacrifice,{03}so a sacrifice must be something{03}pretty scary.{02}{00}
{10} checked the altar.{01}{00}
There wasn't anything special.{02}{00}
It looks like something{03}can be placed here.{02}{00}
{10} placed a doll{03}on the altar.{02}{00}
However, nothing happened.{02}{00}
Who are you?{03}How did you get here?{02}{00}
Only Uzume, Kushinada, and I{03}possess the ability to come here.{02}{00}
Never mind. I don't have time{03}to talk. I have my hands full{03}getting the serpent to drink this.{02}{00}
Once it's groggy,{03}that's when I'll strike...{02}{00}
If you understand, then get{03}out of my way.{03}Stand over there.{02}{00}
How many casks does it take{03}to weaken this stupid serpent?{02}{00}
Move out of the way there.{02}{00}
The cups are overflowing{03}with a river of Dragonsbane.{02}{00}
You! You cannot fight the{03}serpent! Not while it's still in{03}full possession of its senses!{02}{00}
At last... The serpent has{03}finally had its fill. This is{03}the chance I'd hoped for.{02}{00}
I will defeat you before the{03}next full moon and rescue{03}Kushinada myself!{02}{00}
All right, you so-called guardian!{03}Let's see what you've got!{02}{00}
That's weird... It didn't{03}even react...{02}{00}
Feeding the serpent Dragonsbane{03}isn't weakening it enough for{03}me to beat it!{02}{00}
The serpent is still too strong.{01}If only there were a way to{03}weaken it further...{02}{00}
The cups are overflowing{03}with a river of Dragonsbane.{02}{00}
Who do they think they are?{03}I'm the only one who{03}can save Kushinada.{02}{00}
Like I said, the serpent{03}can't be defeated by just{03}weakening it with Dragonsbane.{02}{00}
It looks like the dragon is{03}in bad shape, but it doesn't{03}seem like it's close to dying...{02}{00}
Even though the serpent's{03}been defeated, I can't rest!{02}{00}
Be still, serpent, and I{03}will grant you peace.{02}{00}
And with this, Kushinada's{03}life has been spared.{02}{00}
You have my sincerest thanks.{02}{00}
Where are you going?{02}{00}
To Kushinada, of course.{02}{00}
The serpent, with its eyes closed,{03}looks almost alive.{02}{00}
I'm not dying...{03}I'm just so tired... I'm going{03}to lie down for a bit.{02}{00}
If you're going to Izumo,{03}tell my sister that I'm{03}still alive.{02}{00}
You're going to tell Kushinada{03}that you defeated the serpent,{03}aren't you?{1E}{00}
Ha ha ha! Of course! That's{03}exactly what happened!{02}{00}
Please, you were the ones to{03}defeat it, so you should be{03}honest and accept credit.{02}{00}
I really got worked over,{03}but as long as Kushinada's{03}safe, it was worth it.{02}{00}
Kushinada's safe...{03}She's safe!{03}Nothing else matters.{02}{00}
Those screams from{03}Mt. Mikage... They must{03}have come from the serpent.{01}That means Susa must{03}have saved Kushinada!{02}{00}
We're planning a festival{03}to celebrate the end of the{03}serpent's reign of terror!{01}Lady Uzume is paying{03}for the whole thing, so{03}bring your dancin' feet!{02}{00}
Susa has changed so much{03}from the wild youth we once{03}feared. He's saved our village.{02}{00}
Kushinada has been spared?{03}I'm thrilled beyond words! She{03}did not deserve such a fate...{02}{00}
I've heard people saying that{03}Susa had the help of other{03}heroes... Are you they?{02}{00}
Susa has grown so much{03}to fight for his beloved{03}Kushinada so gallantly.{02}{00}
Susa has put the serpent{03}back to rest, but not everyone{03}seems happy...{02}{00}
Lady Uzume predicted that{03}a great hero would appear{03}to save Kushinada.{01}Nobody thought that hero{03}would be Susa!{02}{00}
See this ring of giant stones?{03}They've been here for ages.{03}No one knows who put them here.{01}See how they make{03}this beautiful circle?{03}Except for that one, right?{1E}{00}
Susa moved it... He didn't even{03}use his hands. He surely holds{03}the secrets to a great power.{02}{00}
You're...not terribly{03}observant, are you?{02}{00}
The misaligned stone! It's{03}back in its original position!{03}How did this happen!?{02}{00}
Hmmm... Either Susa or Kushinada{03}must have moved it when{03}I wasn't looking.{02}{00}
But it's a festival!{03}Why do I have to keep{03}guarding the stone circle?{02}{00}
I had always thought Susa was{03}nothing but a troublemaker, but{03}he's proven himself a hero now!{02}{00}
This celebration will rival the{03}one that woke the serpent in{03}the first place!{02}{00}
It's odd to think that so{03}many in the village once{03}despised Susa...{02}{00}
Kushinada is such a sweet{03}girl. She should never have{03}been chosen in the lottery.{02}{00}
What would make anyone{03}want to race up Mt. Mikage{03}and into the serpent's lair?{02}{00}
All the girls must be so relieved{03}now that that awful lottery{03}has been ended forever.{02}{00}
Everyone's been wondering{03}why the serpent wanted{03}a sacrifice... Was he lonely?{02}{00}
So...Susa really was as much{03}of a hero as Lady Uzume{03}claimed... How disappointing.{02}{00}
Susa did a momentous thing,{03}battling the serpent. So why do{03}I not want to congratulate him?{02}{00}
I wonder if there's someone out{03}there who would sacrifice his{03}life for me. Will I ever find him?{02}{00}
Dancing like this{03}is pure bliss.{02}{00}
Everyone says that Susa is{03}the one to thank for returning{03}peace to our small village.{02}{00}
We may never know what{03}was responsible for waking{03}the serpent from its slumber...{02}{00}
Our island is safe at last!{03}It's time for us to celebrate{03}and enjoy ourselves again!{02}{00}
The serpent taught us one{03}thing: Celebrate while you{03}can, but keep your eyes open!{02}{00}
Lady Uzume and the others{03}aren't really blood relatives.{03}Does that surprise you?{1E}{00}
Well, they do possess a power no{03}one else has... Maybe that means{03}they are siblings after all.{02}{00}
I'm just glad that Lady{03}Uzume used her powers{03}for the good of us all.{02}{00}
All anyone talks about is how Susa{03}risked his life to save Kushinada.{03}I'm so jealous...{02}{00}
A dragon, a hero, a damsel{03}in distress... That's got all the{03}makings for a fairy tale...{02}{00}
Susa said the serpent wasn't{03}all that tough... He makes quite{03}a dashing hero!{02}{00}
We need to figure out what woke{03}the serpent...{03}After the festival, maybe...{02}{00}
Dancing is good for the soul!{01}Oooog... But too much{03}dancing...makes...me...{03}dizzy.{02}{00}
That Susa used my dagger to{03}defeat the serpent.{01}He would never have won{03}if not for my dagger! And{03}he gets all the credit!{02}{00}
As long as we have Lady{03}Uzume, Kushinada, and Susa{03}here, Izumo will be safe.{02}{00}
If you're looking for Kushinada,{03}Lady Uzume escorted her to{03}the mansion.{01}Now that Susa has defeated{03}the serpent, Kushinada is no{03}longer being held as a sacrifice.{02}{00}
Did you hear how Susa{03}defeated the serpent and{03}rescued Kushinada?{01}How come she doesn't{03}seem any happier now{03}that she's free?{02}{00}
Lady Uzume and Kushinada{03}are as close as sisters.{03}It must be nice...{02}{00}
Kushinada must be upset that{03}Susa defied his sister and{03}risked his life for her.{01}She worries about him{03}so much.{02}{00}
Warriors appeared from within{03}Mt. Mikage?{02}{00}
Yes... After the serpent's roar,{03}these warriors appeared.{02}{00}
So, it wasn't Susa who defeated{03}the serpent, but those heroes...{02}{00}
It might have been...{02}{00}
Lady Kushinada, please{03}forgive me...{02}{00}
I don't care who defeated{03}the serpent... I'm more worried{03}about what happened to Susa.{02}{00}
So, Susa never came down{03}from Mt. Mikage?{02}{00}
He returned to the village after{03}the heroes appeared, and he{03}knew the serpent was defeated.{02}{00}
Oh, Susa...{02}{00}
Who are you?{02}{00}
This is my home, and I am{03}having a private conversation.{03}Leave at once!{02}{00}
What is it?{02}{00}
There can be no doubt...{03}These are the heroes who{03}appeared on Mt. Mikage.{02}{00}
Are you the ones who{03}defeated the serpent?{02}{00}
So it was you...{02}{00}
My apologies...{03}You are welcome here.{02}{00}
Who are you?{02}{00}
I'm Kraden, and this{03}is {11}{05}.{02}{00}
Behind him is {11}{08}.{02}{00}
Pleased to meet you.{02}{00}
I'm {11}{06}, and{03}this is {11}{07}.{02}{00}
We're on a quest. Our travels{03}across the Great Eastern{03}Sea brought us here.{02}{00}
You were seen coming down{03}from Mt. Mikage. What brought{03}you to such a dangerous place?{02}{00}
To complete our quest, we{03}need many types of Psynergy.{02}{00}
Psynergy?{02}{00}
What is Psynergy?{02}{00}
Psynergy is many things... The{03}power to move things with{03}one's mind, to heal, to create.{02}{00}
All with one's mind?{02}{00}
Tell me, is it something{03}like...this?{02}{00}
Is that the power you're{03}talking about?{02}{00}
That power?{03}Lady Uzume?{02}{00}
It's not mine alone.{03}Kushinada and Susa{03}possess it as well.{02}{00}
This is the power we possess.{03}I assume you have something{03}like it yourselves?{1E}{00}
I thought so. Only those who{03}can wield the power can see{03}it. And you did see it, didn't you?{02}{00}
{11}{05}, there's no need{03}to hide our abilities from them,{03}is there?{02}{00}
So, you call what we do{03}"Psynergy," and you can{03}do it, too?{02}{00}
If you already have Psynergy,{03}why do you need more of{03}this power?{02}{00}
Their powers are different{03}from our own. There seem to{03}be many forms of Psynergy.{02}{00}
Susa!{02}{00}
Susa...{02}{00}
So, you lived after all, Susa...{02}{00}
Yes, I've survived, and I've{03}made it home to you both.{02}{00}
Thanks to them, actually...{02}{00}
{11}{05}, our gratitude to{03}you and your friends grows{03}deeper each passing moment.{02}{00}
Susa, you spoke of different{03}types of power. Tell me, what{03}did you mean?{02}{00}
I can only describe what{03}I saw, my sister. Ask{03}{11}{05} here about it.{02}{00}
Ah, yes. Psynergy... I have{03}dedicated most of my life{03}to its study...{02}{00}
The power of Psynergy comes{03}from the four basic forces of{03}earth, fire, water, and wind.{01}These energies, the foundations{03}of Alchemy, are called{03}"Elementals."{02}{00}
You don't know Alchemy?{03}The four elements?{01}Why, they're the very{03}building blocks of all{03}matter on Weyard.{02}{00}
All existing matter comes from{03}Alchemy and this Psynergy?{02}{00}
Yes, that's right. Everything{03}you see around you is some{03}combination of these elements.{02}{00}
Does this mean that there{03}are as many types of Psynergy{03}as there are types of elements?{02}{00}
That's right, Kushinada.{03}You're a smart lass.{02}{00}
Mt. Mikage was a place of{03}great earth powers. I'd imagine{03}your powers are earth based.{02}{00}
That's right, but how did{03}you know this?{02}{00}
Kraden... Mt. Mikage is{03}Gaia Rock, isn't it?{02}{00}
...Gaia Rock? Mt. Mikage is{03}the sacred mount of our people!{02}{00}
Yes, but there are many mountains{03}like your Mt. Mikage all across{03}the Eastern Sea.{01}Mt. Mikage is a source of earth{03}power, and therefore, it must{03}be Gaia Rock.{02}{00}
You have seen other mountains{03}like our Mt. Mikage?{02}{00}
Yes! In fact, it seems that{03}each of these rocks contains{03}a different elemental power.{02}{00}
And now, you are questing to{03}gather the power of these{03}elements, yes?{02}{00}
And you only defeated the{03}Great Serpent of Mikage to{03}accomplish this goal?{1E}{00}
Regardless of your motives,{03}you have saved us all.{02}{00}
You took pity on Kushinada?{03}You are very kind to help{03}Susa, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
You're...not implying that we{03}defeated the serpent, are you?{02}{00}
It's true that we did fight{03}the creature...{02}{00}
But without Susa's power,{03}the battle might not have{03}ended so happily.{02}{00}
What... What are you{B0}{02}{00}
Susa had given the beast a{03}lot of Dragonsbane in order{03}to weaken it.{02}{00}
We could never have beaten{03}the beast if it had not been in{03}a...weakened state.{02}{00}
We were victorious only{03}because Susa risked everything{03}to weaken the dragon.{02}{00}
Susa, perhaps, after all, you are...{02}{00}
No, I didn't...{02}{00}
Don't forget, Susa dealt the{03}finishing blow, didn't he?{1E}{00}
Finishing blow? All I{03}did was stab it with{03}the Cloud Brand.{02}{00}
That's right. Piercing it{03}with the Cloud Brand was{03}hardly a finishing blow.{02}{00}
I disagree...{02}{00}
You weakened the serpent.{03}You dealt the final blow.{03}I'd say you were essential.{02}{00}
So, Lady Uzume, wouldn't you{03}say that Susa deserves{03}the reward for this feat?{02}{00}
Even {11}{05} agrees,{03}don't you, {11}{05}?{1E}{00}
I do, too.{02}{00}
We weren't fighting in hopes{03}of getting a reward, were we?{02}{00}
We'll be satisfied just learning{03}your Psynergy.{02}{00}
Are you asking for a reward?{03}That's just plain greedy!{02}{00}
We couldn't possibly take{03}any sort of reward.{02}{00}
Learning new Psynergy{03}will be reward enough.{02}{00}
As you can see.{02}{00}
Now, it's about time for us{03}to leave Izumo Village.{02}{00}
Yes, indeed! We're on{03}our way to Lemuria.{02}{00}
You're leaving so soon?{02}{00}
We are in a great hurry.{02}{00}
Then you must return to{03}Izumo someday.{02}{00}
I'm sure we'll be back{03}once our mission{03}is completed.{02}{00}
Excellent! I shall accept{03}that as your oath!{02}{00}
...Oath?{02}{00}
Oh, by promising to return, we'll{03}be ensuring that our quest will{03}end successfully...{02}{00}
I understand... We must{03}vow to return, everyone.{02}{00}
We'll be waiting.{02}{00}
If you have time, won't{03}you enjoy a little of our{03}celebratory festival?{02}{00}
Someday, Susa and I will have{03}a son, and we will name him{03}Takeru.{01}When he goes to sleep at night,{03}I will tell him the story of your{03}great deeds and your quest.{02}{00}
I'm sure you know the villagers{03}believe I beat the serpent.{03}Don't let me take all the glory!{02}{00}
If {11}{05}'s descendants{03}are ever in trouble, our{03}Takeru will rush to their aid.{02}{00}
I'm no hero, but that shouldn't{03}stop anyone from treating me{03}like one.{02}{00}
And what were you planning{03}to do, once you'd read my{03}mind, hm?{02}{00}
{11}{05}, you read my{03}mind earlier, too, didn't you?{02}{00}
You can't read my mind,{03}but if there is something you{03}want to know, I shall tell you.{02}{00}
Trying again, {11}{05}?{03}What a pest.{01}You can see my mind, but{03}you are incapable of{03}peering into my heart.{02}{00}
{11}{05}, wait!{02}{00}
It troubled me to let you{03}leave like this...{02}{00}
I owe you much for your help,{03}but I didn't have any way to{03}thank you...{02}{00}
And then I thought of something.{02}{00}
You're a warrior, and{03}warriors need weapons.{03}Wouldn't you agree?{1E}{00}
Are you sure about that?{03}I was only hoping to show{03}you my appreciation.{02}{00}
Would you be willing{03}to accept a token{03}of my gratitude?{1E}{00}
This token isn't something{03}I possess. It's a legend, one{03}that might be of use to you.{02}{00}
Long ago, the Great Serpent of{03}Mikage would sleep with its body{03}crossing the river...{02}{00}
Where its tail fell, the{03}Cloud Brand lay hidden.{03}That's the legend, anyway.{02}{00}
The serpent was once the{03}sword's protector, but it lost{03}the sword many ages past.{02}{00}
Anyway, maybe you want{03}to go check out the dragon{03}again...{01}I left something there{03}for you...just as a way{03}of saying thank you.{02}{00}
Well, I've said what I came to{03}say. I'm going back to Kushinada.{02}{00}
I hope you are successful{03}in your quest.{02}{00}
The legend says that the Cloud{03}Brand is a powerful weapon{03}for fighting dragons.{01}I trust you'll test the legend,{03}should the time come.{02}{00}
Times of peace are so dull.{03}It makes me want to do something{03}outrageous to shake things up.{02}{00}
They've been saying that you{03}went into Mt. Mikage, too...{03}Is that true?{1E}{00}
There's a legend about a doll{03}of mysterious power hidden{03}somewhere in the mountain.{01}I'm sure Lady Uzume would{03}by very pleased if you{03}were to find it for her.{02}{00}
Oh... There's an old legend about{03}a dancing doll that has strange{03}powers hidden up there.{01}Lady Uzume really wants that{03}doll. Maybe Susa will find it{03}and bring it back for her...{02}{00}
Supposedly, the doll has the{03}power to move the statues that{03}block light inside the mountain.{02}{00}
Lady Uzume has grown quite{03}fond of this odd creature she{03}found... She's taken it as a pet.{02}{00}
Lady Uzume's new pet affects{03}her powers in weird ways. It{03}doesn't do anything to us...{02}{00}
Why does Lady Uzume want{03}that dancing doll so badly?{02}{00}
I wonder what sort of dance{03}the doll does.{01}I'd love to see what it{03}looked like someday.{02}{00}
I heard that Lady Uzume's pet{03}sometimesi disappears into{03}thin air...{01}Sound a little bit like that{03}cat I had when I was little.{02}{00}
I don't know what it means{03}that Lady Uzume's pet{03}increases her power...{01}But these kids have seen a{03}lot of things I've never seen.{03}Maybe they understand...{02}{00}
Ah... Could it be?{03}Is this the dancing doll{03}of Mt. Mikage?{1E}{00}
You found this at the peak{03}of Mt. Mikage?{02}{00}
Don't lie to me. The style,{03}the craftsmanship... You must{03}have found this on Mt. Mikage.{02}{00}
Again, you have done more{03}for me than I can properly{03}reward you for doing...{02}{00}
I think I may have something{03}that might please you.{02}{00}
This is my pet. It's very{03}dear to me.{02}{00}
I am unsure how it works,{03}but this fellow seems{03}to magnify our power...{02}{00}
Though it saddens me to part{03}with it, I would have you take{03}him, as he might help you...{02}{00}
{11}{05} and his friends have{03}agreed to care for you{03}from now on.{02}{00}
Please, accept this gift.{02}{00}
With this dancing doll, I can{03}explore Mt. Mikage on my own.{03}Take care, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
I'm grateful for the dancing{03}doll, but I do wish you'd stop{03}trying to read my mind.{01}If there is something you wish{03}to know, simply open your mouth{03}and ask.{02}{00}
You must see many wonderful{03}things traveling across the{03}Eastern Sea.{01}How I'd love to travel like you{03}and see such wonders.{02}{00}
My goods are among the{03}best on the island.{01}I'm sure there are things{03}the people on the mainland{03}would love to have.{02}{00}
I'd love to travel the Great{03}Eastern Sea and get things{03}I can't find here on the island.{02}{00}
This may be a small island, but{03}our craftsmanship is as good{03}as anything on the mainland.{01}It may seem impossible now,{03}but one day I'll be trading with{03}the shops in all the big cities.{02}{00}
Briggs, from Champa, hasn't{03}been by selling much fish lately,{03}so our menu's suffered.{02}{00}
As Lady Uzume foretold, the{03}serpent was defeated without{03}returning to our village.{02}{00}
If Briggs's ship doesn't come{03}soon, we won't be able to{03}get any seafood.{01}Until then, all we'll have to{03}eat is freshwater fish.{02}{00}
I understand now!{03}I had no idea why we were{03}preparing all those barrels.{01}If not for those barrels, the{03}serpent just might have{03}destroyed all of Izumo Village.{02}{00}
Now that peace has been{03}restored, our island is{03}flourishing once more.{01}And I am most pleased{03}that we had no need of{03}any sacrifices!{02}{00}
Now that the serpent's been{03}defeated, we don't have to{03}sacrifice anyone!{02}{00}
If you're a sacrifice, that{03}means you have to marry{03}the dragon, right?{01}I'd hate to think what it{03}must be like, cooking for{03}a creature that big.{02}{00}
I thank the powers that be{03}that I was not chosen as{03}a sacrifice.{02}{00}
Maybe now, Kushinada{03}can come out and play.{03}What should we do, though?{02}{00}
That dragon wanted a new{03}wife each and every year!{03}He must really like girls.{02}{00}
{11}{05} searched the slate.{03}There is an inscription.{01}Wielder of Earth's might,{03}Lay your hands upon this stone.{01}I shall grant thee the power{03}to melt into the earth, the{03}power of Sand!{02}{00}
Wielder of Earth's might...{03}That'd be you, {10}.{03}Touch it. Go on, don't worry!{02}{00}
{10} touched the rock.{02}{00}
{10} received{03}the power of Sand.{02}{00}
I'm...sensing something...{02}{00}
I can't feel anything...{02}{00}
I'm done for... That dragon{03}has finished me off...{02}{00}
Oh, I'm so hungry...{03}And there won't be anything{03}to eat until Briggs returns.{02}{00}
When is Briggs going to return{03}with food for the village?{03}We can't wait much longer.{02}{00}
How did you find your way{03}here, to the edge of Angara?{03}Champa is hidden by mountains.{01}No one ever climbs over to{03}see us, except for the monks{03}of the Fuchin Temple.{02}{00}
Champa is impoverished, but{03}soon, we will prosper again.{01}All our hopes rest on Briggs{03}returning with a ship filled{03}with treasures!{02}{00}
You've the look of a traveler{03}about you... Have you been to{03}Ankohl Ruins?{1E}{00}
Only those who have mastered{03}the powers of the earth can{03}enter the ruins.{02}{00}
My mistake... These old eyes{03}aren't what they used to be.{01}Anyway, the ruins are just a{03}little ways northeast of here.{03}You should go see them.{02}{00}
The ruins at Ankohl are all{03}that remains of a great{03}sanctum our ancestors built.{01}They must have been quite{03}wealthy to build such a{03}massive building.{02}{00}
Eoleo, Briggs's son, has a{03}really strange ability...{01}I'll bet if I keep practicing,{03}I'll be able to do it, too, so I'm{03}giving it my all.{02}{00}
Once Briggs comes back,{03}I can play with Eoleo again...{03}I hope they come back soon.{02}{00}
The cliff caves are a lot{03}quieter with Briggs gone... It's{03}a little lonely without him here.{02}{00}
Our matriarch is the last{03}successor of the Ankohl.{01}She's a master of the forge.{03}It was the ancient gift of{03}the Ankohl... {01}There's nothing{03}broken that they couldn't fix.{02}{00}
The Champa sailors aren't...well{03}liked outside of here, are we?{1E}{00}
Hey, that hurts... You could{03}at least lie to me, just to{03}be polite...{01}If you keep spreading rumors{03}like that, you'll have a rough{03}time around here.{02}{00}
Really? That's nice to hear.{03}But if you do hear anything,{03}don't believe a word of it.{02}{00}
Where could Briggs be{03}wasting his time now?{02}{00}
Briggs promised to bring{03}enough food for the whole{03}village.{02}{00}
Champa is all alone on the{03}eastern edge of Angara. That's{03}why we took to the sea.{01}We had to learn to fend for{03}ourselves... That's why we{03}are seafaring people today.{02}{00}
I bet Briggs has already{03}dug up the treasure and is{03}on his way back home.{02}{00}
I want someone to solve{03}the riddle of Ankohl Ruins{03}before I die... It's my one wish!{02}{00}
They say the chamber at the{03}top of the ruins is decorated{03}in the purest gold.{01}Our ancestors must have{03}been wealthy to afford{03}such extravagent decor.{02}{00}
If I could pick up things{03}without using my hands,{03}life would be so much easier.{02}{00}
Eoleo's so much younger than{03}I am, but I can't stop thinking{03}about him... Is that...love?{02}{00}
Why haven't Briggs and{03}his men returned yet?{01}Obaba said not to go looking{03}for them, but what if they're{03}in trouble?{02}{00}
Obaba's locked herself in her{03}room until her grandson, Briggs,{03}returns from sea.{01}She's so worried... She hasn't{03}even been eating. I hope{03}she's all right.{02}{00}
If Briggs would just bring the{03}treasure he found back to{03}Champa, we could all prosper.{01}Then we could put this pirate{03}business behind us for good.{02}{00}
There's not much space in the{03}cliff caves. That's why we have{03}to live out here on the boats.{02}{00}
Everyone in Champa is poor,{03}but the poorest of us all live{03}on rafts... I want to live on land.{02}{00}
When my father heads out{03}to sea, he takes our home{03}with him and leaves us cold.{01}But when he comes home{03}with an empty net, that{03}leaves us cold AND hungry.{02}{00}
My dad went out to fish, but there{03}were no fish to be caught, so he{03}had to come back empty-handed.{02}{00}
These rafts are all we have!{03}There's no place left for us{03}on dry land!{02}{00}
If Dad hadn't been opposed to{03}Briggs becoming a pirate, we'd{03}still be living on land...{02}{00}
I hope Dad makes it back before{03}dark... I don't want to have to{03}sleep on shore with no shelter.{02}{00}
Father worries so much{03}about the lack of fish...{01}He used to come back with fish{03}jumping out of his nets. Why{03}can't he catch fish anymore?{02}{00}
The tidal wave was terrible...{03}It... It nearly swallowed me{03}whole!{02}{00}
It looked to me like the wave{03}came from the Sea of Time.{03}What's in there? What caused it?{02}{00}
Most of the sailors here live in{03}the cliff dwellings, but I don't{03}like those caves. They're dank!{01}And what's worse, the people{03}living in the harbor really{03}resent the cliff-dwellers.{02}{00}
The fish are vanishing. I'm{03}sailing farther and farther{03}for fewer and fewer fish.{02}{00}
Something must have blown up{03}in the Sea of Time. That would{03}explain the tidal wave.{02}{00}
You have to be one of the{03}pirates to live in the cliffs...{03}I just can't do it...{02}{00}
We've seen a lot of traveling{03}warriors in Champa of late.{01}We never used to... I wonder{03}if it's just a coincidence that{03}we've seen so many lately...{02}{00}
A group of travelers came here{03}looking for a {11}{05}.{01}He seems to be a fairly{03}popular guy.{02}{00}
More visitors means more{03}money for our village... Maybe{03}we'll even get tourists soon!{02}{00}
Now that I think about it,{03}someone else was looking{03}for a {11}{05}, too.{01}I'll bet that guy is probably{03}still somewhere in town...{02}{00}
The ocean has been a lot{03}warmer lately, and the fish{03}population is decreasing.{01}It's not natural for the{03}ocean to be so warm.{03}What's causing it?{02}{00}
I've heard rumors of a terrible{03}tidal wave striking the lands{03}south of us.{01}I sure hope Briggs and his{03}men weren't engulfed by it...{02}{00}
We Champa rely entirely on the{03}ocean for our survival. It's all{03}we've ever known...{01}I wish the Eastern Sea would{03}return to its bountiful days of{03}overflowing nets and smooth seas.{02}{00}
All the sailors are saying{03}the tidal wave down south{03}was unbelievably huge.{01}If Briggs were caught up in{03}it, I don't think he could{03}have survived.{02}{00}
Obaba's not seeing anyone{03}right now.{01}She's concerned about her{03}grandson, and she doesn't{03}want to be bothered.{02}{00}
Has my grandson returned?{03}Has my Briggs come home?{1E}{00}
You lie! If Briggs had truly{03}returned, he would have come{03}to see me first!{02}{00}
I asked not to be disturbed{03}until my grandson has returned{03}home! Now, let me be!{02}{00}
That pit is Obaba's forge. She{03}uses it when she's working metal{03}into weapons and equipment.{02}{00}
Before he left, Briggs ordered{03}me to keep watch in his absence.{01}If Obaba is so worried about{03}Briggs, she ought to send{03}someone out to look for him.{02}{00}
All of our men went to sea with{03}Briggs{B0}even my sweetheart!{03}I hope they return soon.{02}{00}
I bet you're wondering why only{03}sailors and their families get to{03}live in the cliff dwellings.{01}Well, from up here on the cliffs,{03}families can look out to sea and{03}await the return of their sailors.{02}{00}
The Champa sailors who don't{03}live in the cliffs are no better{03}than cowards.{01}The ones living in the caves will{03}protect Briggs and Obaba{03}without a second thought.{02}{00}
My husband wants our children{03}to be sailors like him, but I{03}simply won't have it.{02}{00}
Someday, I want to be a sailor,{03}like my father before me. My{03}mother hates the idea, though.{01}She'd rather have me study and{03}become a scholar or something.{02}{00}
Mom's had it pretty rough. I hope{03}I meet a sailor with a future, so I{03}don't have to work so hard.{02}{00}
I've never seen Obaba like{03}this before.{01}She must be really worried{03}about Briggs...{02}{00}
I wonder how deep this forge{03}goes. It's supposed to reach{03}right into the mountain's heart.{01}Obaba must be a master of the{03}forge if she's the only one{03}who can call up its flames.{02}{00}
Briggs may be our captain, but{03}at least he's not all full of{03}himself. I hate people like that.{02}{00}
Briggs is the greatest{03}among all our sailors.{01}As long as he is leading our{03}men, they'll make it back to{03}Champa just fine.{02}{00}
Standing here, staring across the{03}sea from these cliffs, makes me{03}feel like I'm helping our sailors.{02}{00}
If you live up in the cliffs, that{03}means you've proven that you{03}can travel far across the seas.{01}If you call yourself a sailor{03}without ever going anywhere,{03}you're not worthy of the title.{02}{00}
When I married a sailor, I knew{03}how cruel the sea could be.{01}I can't stop my husband from{03}sailing, but I don't want our{03}children to follow that path.{02}{00}
Has Mom forgotten that{03}I am my father's son?{01}If she knew anything about{03}me, she'd never ask me to{03}give up the sailor's life.{02}{00}
Eoleo is the only boy in town{03}who will amount to anything...{03}He will be mine!{02}{00}
I have some lovely artifacts,{03}but it's only because I've been{03}to the Ankohl Ruins.{02}{00}
If you go to the Ankohl Ruins,{03}you might find some nice{03}artifacts for yourself.{02}{00}
Our products cost what they cost{03}for a reason: they're all rare and{03}valuable treasures from Ankohl.{01}If I risk my life to get something{03}nice, of course I'm going to ask{03}a higher price for it!{02}{00}
The stuff in the ruins just sits{03}there waiting for someone to{03}come along and take it.{01}But if it's broken, I'm the only{03}guy in town who can fix it.{02}{00}
Listen, if you came to Champa{03}looking for good seafood, you{03}came to the wrong place.{01}We haven't had a decent{03}catch in months. It's like{03}all the fish are just...gone.{02}{00}
We used to do good trade{03}with an island east of us. They{03}bought all our surplus fish.{01}We don't have any surplus{03}anymore. We don't even have{03}enough for ourselves.{02}{00}
It's a shame that we can't{03}offer any fish to our customers.{01}Ah, how I long for the days{03}when we had fish enough{03}for everyone.{02}{00}
Watching our catches dwindle{03}with every day... It's a nightmare!{03}Where have all the fish gone?{02}{00}
Briggs bears the weight{03}of hope for our struggling,{03}impoverished village.{01}He must return home soon,{03}before all the villagers lose hope{03}and fall into despair.{02}{00}
I hope Briggs brings something{03}home for us... If not, it might{03}be the end of Champa...{02}{00}
I see you've caught up with{03}me again, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
Alex!{02}{00}
Alex? Who is Alex?{02}{00}
Alex is a Water Adept. We had{03}been traveling together, but he{03}left us when we landed on Indra.{02}{00}
A Water Adept?{02}{00}
Ah, and I see you've made{03}a new friend! You have been{03}busy, haven't you?{1E}{00}
And you've found yourself a{03}new Water Adept! Do you mean{03}to cast me away, like old trash?{02}{00}
Please... It's quite obvious that{03}you decided to replace me with{03}a new Water Adept.{01}I expect you thought you'd{03}never see me again!{02}{00}
What do you want with us now,{03}Alex? Or did you forget you were{03}the one who abandoned US?{02}{00}
My dear {11}{06}...{02}{00}
Have you come to despise me{03}so, after all we've been through?{1E}{00}
That's right, {11}{05}! Why should{03}we care about someone who{03}just left us behind like that!?{02}{00}
Duh! You're the one who left{03}us. It's pretty clear who{03}despises whom here.{02}{00}
My, aren't we a bitter bunch?{03}And I was just trying to help{03}you with your little task.{02}{00}
We have no need of your help.{03}We can light the lighthouses{03}without you.{02}{00}
Oh... Can you really?{02}{00}
Karst!{02}{00}
That's right, Karst! I'm{03}flattered that you remember!{02}{00}
What is this, Alex?{03}What's going on?{02}{00}
Ah, how can I explain this...{02}{00}
What's going on is Alex is{03}demonstrating his remarkable{03}foresight once again!{02}{00}
Oh, have you not had the{03}pleasure of an introduction?{02}{00}
He stayed back at the ship{03}when I saw them in Madra.{02}{00}
I am Agatio.{02}{00}
Let's see... That guy's {11}{05},{03}and the girls are {11}{06} and {11}{07},{03}which makes him...Kraden.{02}{00}
They look like an unreliable{03}bunch of ragamuffins.{02}{00}
Yes, they are rather useless,{03}aren't they? That's why I finally{03}had to abandon them, of course.{02}{00}
But now, I believe I may have{03}been...hasty in my judgment.{02}{00}
You are {11}{08}?{02}{00}
H-How do you know my name?{02}{00}
How soon they forget!{03}We met you before, when you{03}were being...detained.{02}{00}
Who could forget the amateur{03}Adept changing water to ice{03}in that strange little town?{02}{00}
Ah! You saw that! That must{03}be how you knew {11}{08}{03}was a Water Adept.{02}{00}
In fact, I was even thinking of{03}borrowing his ship at one point.{02}{00}
You would steal someone's{03}boat? That's so typical, Alex!{02}{00}
You wound me, {11}{06}...{03}I only meant to borrow it.{02}{00}
Whatever you might have{03}meant, that doesn't make it right!{02}{00}
And just when I was about{03}to seize the opportunity,{03}you had to come back.{02}{00}
You mean from Kibombo...{02}{00}
I was mere moments too late.{02}{00}
Isn't that a shame.{02}{00}
Still, because of that, I did{03}meet Karst and Agatio, so{03}perhaps it was my fate...{02}{00}
Can't you just stop talking about{03}yourself for one second, Alex?{02}{00}
Enough of your childish gibes!{03}Alex, I want to know what{03}makes these punks useful!{02}{00}
Because they brought us the orb{03}that Akafubu had taken. That{03}shows some resourcefulness.{02}{00}
How so?{02}{00}
The Kibombo are quite warlike...{03}or were, at any rate. Recovering{03}the orb was most likely not easy.{02}{00}
They were just typical villagers,{03}easily frightened with a small{03}display of Psynergy...{02}{00}
No... They would have used less{03}abrupt methods than those you{03}favor...{02}{00}
Oh? What methods would{03}those be?{02}{00}
Alex said it clearly enough.{03}We wouldn't terrorize people{03}into doing what we wanted.{02}{00}
Enough of this!{02}{00}
Stop changing the subject!{03}When are you going to light{03}the remaining lighthouses?{02}{00}
Yes! Our patience is beginning{03}to wear thin!{02}{00}
If you waste much more of our{03}time, we'll take those Elemental{03}Stars and do it ourselves!{02}{00}
If we had a Wind Adept like{03}{11}{07} and the Elemental{03}Stars, we wouldn't need you.{02}{00}
Excuse me?{02}{00}
I am, of course, opposed{03}to their line of thinking.{02}{00}
My experience with Saturos{03}and Menardi suggests that,{03}while they were fierce warriors...{01}They are somewhat lacking{03}when it comes to solving the{03}mysteries of the lighthouses...{02}{00}
You mean to say that they{03}failed to solve the riddles?{02}{00}
Miserably...{02}{00}
Are you suggesting they were{03}simple brutes, incapable of{03}logic and intelligence?{01}And are you saying the{03}same of us!?{02}{00}
I'm afraid so...{02}{00}
Alex... Whose side{03}are you on?{02}{00}
I am on no one's side. My only{03}concern is to see the lighthouse{03}beacons lit once again.{02}{00}
So you mean to leave the{03}task to {11}{05}?{02}{00}
Then why have we come all this{03}way looking for {11}{05}?{02}{00}
I merely wanted to confirm{03}that he and his companions{03}had not forgotten their quest.{02}{00}
Is that truly all?{02}{00}
I also wanted to introduce{03}{11}{05} to the two of you.{02}{00}
Why would you want to do that?{02}{00}
With Saturos and Menardi gone,{03}you probably felt very little{03}pressure to complete your task.{01}I cannot have that.{02}{00}
What do you mean by that!?{02}{00}
With Saturos and Menardi gone,{03}I felt another pair might...{03}How shall I put this...{01}Provide you with the proper{03}incentive to complete your task.{02}{00}
Is that some kind of threat?{02}{00}
Take it as you wish. I just{03}wanted to provide you with{03}the proper encouragement.{02}{00}
So, what? You've used us to{03}your satisfaction, and now,{03}our role is done?{02}{00}
You only wanted us around to{03}flex a little muscle and scare{03}them into action? Fine.{02}{00}
I suppose we will let you{03}go today...{02}{00}
But we will always be nearby...{03}pushing you to make your way{03}to Jupiter Lighthouse swiftly.{02}{00}
I look forward to seeing you{03}soon, {11}{05}, somewhere{03}very near Jupiter Lighthouse.{02}{00}
Kraden, am I right in recalling{03}that you pursue this quest on{03}the behalf of Tolbi's ruler, Babi?{02}{00}
This is true. I'm studying{03}Alchemy because Lord Babi{03}has ordered it.{02}{00}
What about it?{02}{00}
Ah, what a pity. It would{03}seem all your studies...{03}have been for naught.{02}{00}
What are you getting at, Alex?{02}{00}
Only that it seems your Lord{03}Babi has at last succumbed{03}to the ravages of time.{02}{00}
Lord Babi is dead?{02}{00}
Oh, so you didn't know?{02}{00}
Lord Babi? Dead? Could{03}that really be true?{02}{00}
Alex! How would you know{03}such a thing?{02}{00}
Do not mistake me! We had no{03}hand in Babi's passing.{02}{00}
However, the people of Tolbi{03}may be under the impression that{03}our presence led to his death.{02}{00}
Alex! Cut the melodrama{03}and get to the point for a{03}change!{02}{00}
Simply put, I would recommend{03}against traveling to north{03}Gondowan for a while.{02}{00}
I just thought it might be better{03}if you focused on your quest,{03}instead of exploration, for now...{02}{00}
How kind of you.{02}{00}
Take it as you will...{02}{00}
Very well. May we meet again.{02}{00}
So the only reason Alex came{03}here was to threaten us?{02}{00}
And to bring us news of Babi's{03}death, despite the fact that we{03}asked for no such news!{02}{00}
Perhaps he had his own reasons{03}for telling Kraden...{02}{00}
What do you mean, {11}{08}?{02}{00}
If Kraden undertook this quest{03}on behalf of Babi, then he no{03}longer has any need{B0}{02}{00}
Oh. Of course! I hadn't thought{03}of that. Your orders were to find{03}Lemuria, right, Kraden?{02}{00}
That's right. But if Babi really{03}has died, you're free to go{03}where you will, Kraden.{02}{00}
That's not true, {11}{07}.{02}{00}
Certainly, my original reason{03}for researching Alchemy was{03}for Lord Babi...{02}{00}
"Was for Lord Babi"? That's{03}the past tense! What are your{03}reasons now?{02}{00}
This is no longer solely for{03}research... I do this because of{03}what I've learned on this quest.{02}{00}
Your research?{02}{00}
What you learned on this quest?{02}{00}
I'm not following you at all!{1E}{00}
I don't understand a word of this.{1E}{00}
Of course you don't! {11}{05}{03}is the only one I've spoken{03}to about any of this...{02}{00}
What!? You knew!?{1E}{00}
That's not fair! Tell us!{1E}{00}
Please, {11}{05}... Let's not{03}say too much about it just yet.{02}{00}
{11}{05} is right. Now is{03}not the time to tell you{03}about it all...{02}{00}
It's...far too complicated.{02}{00}
Well, when WILL you tell us?{02}{00}
I am sure we will tell you once{03}we get to Lemuria.{02}{00}
Do you promise?{02}{00}
I promise...{02}{00}
{11}{08}? You don't{03}mind waiting?{02}{00}
I cannot read minds, like{03}{11}{07}, but I have a guess{03}at what you're thinking...{02}{00}
A guess? What do you mean?{02}{00}
You are a great scholar,{03}Kraden, are you not?{02}{00}
I believe your theory is correct.{03}And to prove it, I want to return{03}to Lemuria as soon as possible.{02}{00}
Getting Trident (TEMP){02}{00}
It's the middle of three tines.{02}{00}
It reads: Search by the water's{03}edge where the letter had fallen.{02}{00}
It reads: Two Steps north of the{03}middle grave where the{03}letter had fallen.{02}{00}
Champa ahead!{02}{00}
Hey! That block on the{03}mast has disappeared!{02}{00}
Hey! Now, we can raise the mast{03}and use the sail again!{02}{00}
Hey, mate, let's go tell the{03}mayor the good news!{02}{00}
Yeah, let's do that!{02}{00}
Baba babubu!! {02}{00}
What is it, Eoleo? What{03}are you so excited about?{02}{00}
Baba babubu!{02}{00}
It's true! The block that was{03}pinning the mast down is gone!{02}{00}
You were the ones who{03}did it, weren't you?{1E}{00}
I knew you would{03}do it someday.{02}{00}
But, of course, I also know that{03}you didn't do it for our benefit.{02}{00}
Still, Briggs will be pleased{03}when he hears about this.{02}{00}
Well then, let's go tell him!{02}{00}
I still just can't quite believe{03}that the stone block on top of{03}the mast has totally vanished.{02}{00}
I'm telling you, Mayor, I saw{03}it with my own eyes! ...I mean,{03}I didn't see it! It's gone!{02}{00}
If you don't believe us, you{03}can go see for yourself!{02}{00}
Huh?{02}{00}
What?{02}{00}
Whoa, hey!!!{02}{00}
It's gone! That huge block{03}is really gone!{02}{00}
Excellent news, Mayor!{02}{00}
Unfortunately, the mayor of{03}Madra will probably try to{03}take it from us now.{02}{00}
But that can wait. Who was{03}able to move the block?{02}{00}
{11}{05}!{02}{00}
{11}{05}, did you do this?{02}{00}
Surprised to see us, Mayor?{02}{00}
Did you do this?{02}{00}
We left Alhafra some time ago,{03}but we just returned and{03}destroyed the stone block.{02}{00}
Exploring? What brought you{03}back to Alhafra right now?{02}{00}
{11}{05} had a hunch that{03}we might be needed here.{02}{00}
Mayor, not to interrupt, but{03}shouldn't we begin repairs{03}on your ship now?{02}{00}
Yes, yes... You're right, of course.{02}{00}
Gather the townspeople and{03}get them to work on the mast.{02}{00}
Yes, sir! We're on our way!{02}{00}
We shouldn't need too many{03}people to raise the mast!{02}{00}
All right. I'm counting on you.{02}{00}
Destroying that stone must{03}have been quite a challenge.{02}{00}
Why don't you come back to{03}my manor to get some rest?{1E}{00}
We could use the rest,{03}{11}{05}. We should accept{03}the mayor's offer.{02}{00}
You're too kind, Mayor. We'd{03}be happy to...{02}{00}
Thank you again, Mayor.{03}You keep a fine house.{02}{00}
Don't be silly. You've done{03}us a great deed.{02}{00}
It was the least{03}I could do.{02}{00}
Even if he gets the boat fixed,{03}I don't think he's going to hand{03}it over to Madra...{02}{00}
I agree... He's being way too{03}nice for me not to be a little{03}suspicious of him...{02}{00}
I'm sorry, did you girls{03}have something you'd{03}like to share with us?{02}{00}
I see!{02}{00}
Jiya, how are the repairs coming{03}along? Things seem to be moving{03}slowly down there.{02}{00}
Milord, these things take time...{02}{00}
Sir, there's a problem!{02}{00}
Calm down, man! You're a{03}soldier! What are you so{03}flustered about!?{02}{00}
Briggs destroyed the prison{03}and escaped with his pirates!{02}{00}
What, were you asleep while{03}this was going on?{02}{00}
Don't... Don't be silly!{02}{00}
How could Briggs possibly{03}break out of our prison? It's{03}one of the strongest in Osenia!{02}{00}
I don't know what happened,{03}but before I knew it, they'd{03}smashed a hole in the wall!{02}{00}
Mayor! The mast has been{03}raised!{02}{00}
Hey, what's up?{02}{00}
Wait, you're supposed to{03}be guarding the prisoners...{03}What happened?{02}{00}
It appears that Briggs{03}has escaped.{02}{00}
That's no good...{02}{00}
What are you standing around{03}for!? Search the area! Find{03}Briggs at once!{02}{00}
It...might not be quite{03}that easy...{02}{00}
He is a pirate, after all...{03}A famous one!{02}{00}
Enough of that! Move it!{02}{00}
Regardless, I'm going to go{03}inspect my boat...{02}{00}
Oh, and {11}{05} and his crew{03}were there, too, weren't they?{02}{00}
I treated you like an honored{03}guest in my home...{02}{00}
Usually, one feels a certain{03}obligation to those who do them{03}such a kind service, am I right?{02}{00}
So, don't just stand there!{03}Return the favor and find{03}me Briggs!{02}{00}
Come on! Hurry up!{03}Let's go! Move it!{02}{00}
Let's go see the boat.{02}{00}
The mayor of Alhafra certainly{03}does know how to look out for{03}his own interest, doesn't he?{02}{00}
That's one way of putting it!{02}{00}
Well, so what do we do? Do{03}we go after Briggs?{1E}{00}
Don't feel like you have to{03}do them any favors!{02}{00}
That's right! Why should we{03}help the mayor, after the way{03}he treated you!{02}{00}
{11}{05} can decide for{03}himself what to do...{02}{00}
At the very least, I want to{03}go see the sailing ship{03}now that it's fixed.{02}{00}
Let's just go outside and{03}take a quick look.{02}{00}
Everyone in town is talking{03}about how the boat's finally{03}been fixed! You should see it!{02}{00}
The whole town is grateful to{03}you... Without your help, we{03}couldn't have fixed the mast!{02}{00}
I'm just standing guard, in{03}case Briggs decides to{03}attack the mayor's manor.{02}{00}
Our sailboat looks fabulous{03}with its mast repaired! You{03}really must go check it out!{02}{00}
I wonder where Briggs and{03}his crew went... There's no sign{03}of them around here...{02}{00}
I heard you made it so we{03}could fix our sailboat! Is there{03}anything you CAN'T do?{02}{00}
Ever since we heard Briggs{03}broke out of jail, we've all{03}been a little nervous...{02}{00}
I don't know why everyone's so{03}excited about fixing the ship. We{03}promised it to Madra, didn't we?{02}{00}
Oh! It's you! Where have you{03}been? We haven't seen you{03}around Alhafra lately...{02}{00}
With that ship, Alhafra's going{03}to become a big, important{03}trading town... We'll all be rich!{02}{00}
Once that stone was taken{03}care of, it was really quite{03}easy to raise the mast again.{02}{00}
If Briggs is smart, he's{03}probably long gone from{03}Alhafra, if you ask me.{02}{00}
I've been waiting for this day{03}for years! I can't wait to set{03}sail across the Eastern Sea.{02}{00}
The secret to harnessing the{03}wind's power is building a small{03}ship. Large ones can't do it.{02}{00}
I'm sure it's just a coincidence,{03}but whenever you show up,{03}trouble happens.{02}{00}
The mayor was actually singing{03}and skipping when he went to{03}the dock. He seemed so pleased.{02}{00}
Weird... Have you ever had the{03}feeling that someone just{03}passed by? Maybe it's just me.{02}{00}
Huge boats carry more, but{03}we need smaller ships to{03}catch the wind.{01}The mayor just doesn't{03}understand this...{02}{00}
I don't know what the big{03}rush is. We can see the boat{03}whenever we want. It's ours!{02}{00}
Now that the boat is fixed,{03}who gets to keep it? Us? Or{03}the Madrans?{02}{00}
I'm supposed to be guarding{03}in case Briggs shows up. But{03}if he does, I'll probably just cry.{02}{00}
Who cares if the boat is fixed?{03}It's not like we'll be allowed on{03}board. The mayor's too selfish.{02}{00}
Why do I have to look for{03}Briggs? It's not my fault{03}he escaped...{02}{00}
I hate to tell {11}{05}, but{03}even though our mayor seems{03}nice, he's really a selfish jerk.{02}{00}
I'd bet that Briggs fled the{03}city at the first chance. I really{03}wonder if he'd still be here.{02}{00}
Briggs paid a lot for a broken{03}boat, but now that it's fixed, it's{03}practically priceless!{02} {00}
{11}{05} must have found himself{03}a boat... Isn't that what brought{03}him to Alhafra in the first place?{02}{00}
I'm certain the only person to{03}prosper from the boat will be{03}that oaf of a mayor.{02}{00}
Now that all the debris{03}has been cleared away,{03}our harbor looks so nice.{02}{00}
The mayor said I had to look{03}for pirates... Where am I{03}supposed to be looking?{02}{00}
I'm probably too old for the{03}mayor to let me on the ship,{03}but I can still have my dreams.{02}{00}
Smaller ships use their sails{03}to steer a lot, but it must be{03}harder when your ship's so big.{02}{00}
It's been so busy around here...{03}Pirates, warriors, sailing ships,{03}natural disasters. What a week!{02}{00}
The mayor only had one thing{03}on his mind on his way to the{03}dock... Money, and lots of it.{02}{00}
What if the pirates were{03}nearby... Maybe that was{03}them behind the building...{02}{00}
Without smaller ships, how{03}can we catch the fish we{03}need to eat?{02}{00}
Oooog... Ow...{02}{00}
Why do these things{03}always happen to me?{02}{00}
Stupid Briggs...{02}{00}
Briggs's pirates... They{03}attacked us and...{03}The ship... The ship...{02}{00}
I just came down to see the{03}repaired mast, and they jumped{03}on me from out of nowhere.{02}{00}
Briggs said the boat was{03}his... And, to be honest, they{03}had paid us for it, but...{02}{00}
Briggs!!!{02}{00}
Briggs, where are you{03}taking my boat?{02}{00}
He's attempting to steal it!{03}Thief! Thief!{02}{00}
Did you call me a thief?{02}{00}
I paid for this boat, fair{03}and square. I'm no thief.{02}{00}
You're the thieves! You tried{03}to take our boat away, after{03}we paid you so much for it!{02}{00}
... ...{02}{00}
You're the one who{03}stole OUR boat!{02}{00}
Ahoy, Briggs!{02}{00}
Uh-oh... It's {11}{05}!{02}{00}
You're not afraid of{03}them, are you?{02}{00}
Look how far away they are...{03}There's no way they can{03}catch us now!{02}{00}
You're right... They're stuck on{03}the land, and we've got this boat!{02}{00}
They can't catch us...{03}What would they do, swim?{02}{00}
Hah! You're right! They can't{03}board us from way over there!{02}{00}
Wasn't there something you{03}wanted to do the next time{03}you saw {11}{05}?{02}{00}
Don't tell me you forgot...{03}It's all you ever talked about{03}when you were in jail!{02}{00}
Oh yeah... I almost forgot.{02}{00}
So now's your chance!{03}Do what you swore to do!{02}{00}
Bleah!{02}{00}
Is that the best you could{03}come up with?{02}{00}
But, Chaucha, they're an{03}awfully tough bunch...{02}{00}
See? It's that attitude right{03}there! That's why you'll{03}never amount to anything!{02}{00}
You know what? You're right!{02}{00}
Hey! {11}{05}!{03}You guys take care!{01}And keep Alhafra safe{03}from thieves and pirates!{03}And politicians, too!{02}{00}
What!?!{02}{00}
I doubt we'll ever meet{03}again, but if we do,{03}remember this!{02}{00}
Neener neener neener!{03}Neener neener neener!{02}{00}
Neener neener bleah!{02}{00}
That may have been a bit much.{03}If you make him mad, he might{03}chase us right back to Champa.{02}{00}
What!!! You let Briggs{03}get away!{02}{00}
You and your friends talk a{03}good game, but when trouble{03}happens, where are you!?{02}{00}
Well, isn't this a fine mess!{02}{00}
My prize ship, stolen by a{03}bunch of filthy pirate scum!{02}{00}
Get up!{02}{00}
They're gone, and you let{03}them escape!{02}{00}
You guys have royally botched{03}this one. This ruins everything!{02}{00}
You all ought to be ashamed! All{03}of you were cowering, while I was{03}the only one to stand up to them!{02}{00}
All of you!{02}{00}
I'm going back to my manor!{02}{00}
And you, {11}{05}. I am{03}extremely disappointed in you.{02}{00}
There will be no reward for{03}you, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
You let that Briggs steal MY{03}ship! You're lucky I don't lock{03}you up in his stead!{02}{00}
Bah! I've had enough of this!{03}Don't just stand there with your{03}mouths gaping! Get out of here!{02}{00}
We don't have a boat, so there's{03}no reason for anyone to be{03}here at the port. Return to town.{02}{00}
What an awful person.{03}Do you suppose he's always{03}this self-centered?{1E}{00}
Yes, he's terribly irritating.{03}You're quite right, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
You can stay calm after{03}listening to that windbag?{03}That's quite mature of you.{02}{00}
I'll wager Briggs is returning{03}to Champa, personally.{02}{00}
Well, it doesn't matter. I think{03}I've had enough of this town.{03}Shall we be leaving?{1E}{00}
Ah, yes, well... If you still have{03}business to attend to here.{02}{00}
All right. But the sooner we leave,{03}the better. Lead on, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
Great! Let's leave as soon{03}as possible, shall we?{02}{00}
Alhafra lost its ship. Now, we're{03}nothing but a big, boring town{03}in the middle of Osenia.{02}{00}
Even though we lost the big boat,{03}I'm not particularly upset.{01}We'll be just fine if everyone{03}can work together and build{03}a fleet of smaller boats.{02}{00}
After we did all that work to{03}fix the mast, someone goes and{03}steals our boat.{01}We never should have fixed{03}it in the first place.{02}{00}
It was great to see everyone{03}in town working to raise the{03}mast. Too bad the boat got stolen.{02}{00}
When they find that their boat was{03}stolen, I'm sure Madra's not going{03}to be too happy.{02}{00}
It's not like the boat could{03}even move when the mast{03}was still broken...{01}When you think of it that{03}way, it doesn't feel like we{03}really lost anything at all.{02}{00}
The repairs are coming along{03}pretty slowly, aren't they?{01}Well, you wouldn't feel much{03}like working either if your last{03}major project was stolen!{02}{00}
When is this house going to be{03}finished once and for all!? The{03}repairs are taking forever!{02}{00}
It felt so great when the whole{03}town joined together to get{03}those boat repairs done.{02}{00}
Back before Briggs destroyed{03}the bridge to the west, it was{03}a lot easier to trade with Madra.{02}{00}
We fixed the mast so we{03}could use that boat.{01}Now, Briggs has taken the boat{03}and sailed off to Champa.{02}{00}
If they caught a good breeze,{03}they're probably way off to the{03}north of us by now.{02}{00}
If only we had that ship, Alhafra{03}could have been a powerful{03}trading town...and wealthy, too...{02}{00}
I hope trade doesn't make{03}Alhafra get all big. I like how{03}quiet things are around here...{01}We should stay a small town,{03}with our small little boats.{02}{00}
It was Madra's boat. It{03}should have been Madra's{03}problem...{02}{00}
The mayor seemed so happy to{03}see us working on the boat...{03}That's kind of strange.{01}After all, we were only fixing{03}it so we could give it to{03}Madra, weren't we?{02}{00}
The mayor of Madra seems like{03}a reasonable person. It's too{03}bad this had to happen.{02}{00}
We're all pulling together to fix{03}this house. At least everyone{03}is helping with the work.{02}{00}
If Mom would stop making all{03}these trifling little requests,{03}we'd be done a lot faster...{02}{00}
I know it's time to forget about{03}that boat and get back to work...{03}But I just can't let it go.{02}{00}
First, he steals a ship...then he{03}ruins a very important bridge...{03}Briggs is a real jerk.{02}{00}
Why worry about Briggs? It's{03}not as though we've got a boat{03}to chase him with...{02}{00}
If Briggs hadn't stolen that{03}boat, I'd be out on the open{03}sea right now, wind in my hair.{02}{00}
There's no point in worrying{03}about losing something we{03}never had to begin with.{02}{00}
I don't want to say this{03}out loud or anything, but...{01}Briggs paid for that boat{03}fair and square. He didn't{03}steal it at all.{02}{00}
Briggs didn't commit any{03}crimes in Alhafra, did he?{02}{00}
Briggs paid for the boat and{03}then left in it. Why is everyone{03}treating him like a crook?{02}{00}
I don't believe for one second{03}that Briggs was a pirate,{03}raiding the towns of Indra.{02}{00}
Fixing that old guy's house is{03}starting to drive us all crazy.{01}I, for one, will be ready for a{03}celebration once it's done.{02}{00}
The repairs on our neighbors'{03}house are moving slowly.{01}The longer it takes, the longer{03}they live with us!{02}{00}
My house is damaged more than{03}I thought. Looks like I'm still{03}stuck here with my neighbors.{02}{00}
My husband and I don't get{03}out much, and it's nice to{03}meet the neighbors...{01}But we've been here for so{03}long, I don't think we'll be{03}going out for quite a while.{02}{00}
Will they ever get out of my{03}house? It's starting to worry{03}me a bit...{02}{00}
I don't have anything to say{03}to them, and I'm tired of being{03}the good hostess all the time!{02}{00}
I don't mind not being at{03}home, but my wife wants{03}her privacy back!{02}{00}
I hated this place at first, but it's{03}grown on me. I feel so much more{03}sociable now...{02}{00}
That guy's house isn't fixed,{03}and he won't help out on our{03}house until his is done.{02}{00}
The mayor's been handing out{03}free food to help us all through{03}these difficult times.{01}The way things have been{03}going, though, I bet everyone{03}just hoards it all.{02}{00}
We have to store what food we get{03}from the mayor and only eat a{03}little bit of it at a time.{02}{00}
We could use some help with{03}the house, but it looks like{03}we're on our own for now.{02}{00}
I don't know what will happen{03}if the repairs aren't done before{03}winter hits...{02}{00}
I've seen Father trying to do some{03}repairs, but it's too much work{03}for him to do on his own.{02}{00}
Even if we fix it, the columns{03}and the walls will collapse...{03}They always do...{02}{00}
With everyone's help, we were{03}somehow able to avoid the wind{03}and rain at least.{01}You know, after all this, I now{03}understand how difficult it{03}is to be a carpenter.{02}{00}
Mom was happy to hear that{03}the repairs were coming along{03}nicely. The thing is, they're not.{02}{00}
There are a lot of houses in{03}need of repair. Until the others{03}are finished, I'll wait quietly.{02}{00}
This is just too much work{03}for one man to get done.{01}I need to stop and get some{03}rest, but I promised I'd finish...{02}{00}
He's never going to get{03}finished with that terrible{03}attitude of his.{01}Until he feels like working,{03}nothing much is going to{03}get done around here.{02}{00}
There's no way Dad can fix{03}this house up all by himself.{03}It's a mess!{02}{00}
Carrying these things all over has{03}gotten my hands all torn up.{03}I feel so...rugged!{02}{00}
Everyone's saying that Briggs{03}probably escaped by tunneling{03}through the mayor's manor.{02}{00}
Supposedly, the cave under the{03}mayor's manor is treacherous.{01}You'd have to be pretty tough{03}to make it out of there alive.{02}{00}
So, Briggs stole Madra's ship{03}right out from under our{03}own greedy mayor?{01}Ah, 'tis an ill wind that...{03}that...um... Oh, I forget how it{03}goes. But it's bad, trust me.{02}{00}
I don't know... I never really{03}thought the mayor would give{03}that boat to Madra anyway.{01}Our mayor's far too greedy to{03}pass up an opportunity like{03}this.{02}{00}
The bridge to the west of{03}us is all fixed now, just so{03}you know.{02}{00}
People will start traveling again,{03}and they'll need to buy equipment...{03}My equipment!{02}{00}
We're still recovering from the{03}damage the tidal wave caused.{01}Once the reconstruction is{03}complete, Alhafra will be the{03}perfect town... Indestructible!{02}{00}
The mayor used the money{03}he got from Madra to pay{03}for all our food.{01}Everything was looking good,{03}until the boat got stolen...{03}That sort of killed morale.{02}{00}
It seems that Briggs broke{03}out of jail with the help{03}of his wife, Chaucha.{02}{00}
Briggs might have had a{03}key, but I think he used{03}a different escape route...{01}I mean, walking out the{03}front door of our jail would{03}have been really stupid!{02}{00}
A bigger boat could haul in{03}more fish, but right now, just{03}about anything will do!{02}{00}
I just want a house where{03}we can all live together{03}without fighting!{02}{00}
Someone said my son and my{03}grandchildren are fixing the{03}house. They're so considerate...{02}{00}
So that Alex fellow left already,{03}did he? He's such a rogue... Is{03}he running from something?{02}{00}
After the tidal wave, it was{03}one complaint after another,{03}but things have quieted down.{01}Everyone's been pulling together{03}to get this work done, and we've{03}set our differences aside.{02}{00}
The mayor may have pulled{03}through the tidal wave just{03}fine, but his town didn't!{01}How could he even {09}{02}consider{07}{03}punishing me for trying to feed{03}all these unfortunate souls?{02}{00}
Briggs and his wife were{03}totally planning this jailbreak{03}when she saw him there...{01}What was the guard doing?{03}Wasn't he watching his{03}prisoner? Was he napping?{02}{00}
If I had a key, I would have{03}used it. That's for sure...{01}Briggs escaped through the{03}caves, though... That pirate's{03}a wily one.{02}{00}
So what if trade brings people{03}here? Things are so bad, we{03}can't even offer a decent meal!{02}{00}
I'd really like to have a pet, but{03}I know better. Things are too{03}tough right now.{02}{00}
Isn't anyone helping my family{03}with the house? I'm an old man,{03}and it'll take them years to finish!{02}{00}
He was just my type... Aloof,{03}strong, blue haired...{01}But he was a little too aloof.{03}He... He never even said{03}good-bye...{02}{00}
I heard you were there when{03}Briggs escaped on the sailing{03}ship.{01}A villain like Briggs should{03}never have been allowed to{03}escape. It's a terrible thing.{02}{00}
They were so confident when{03}they caught him before, but they{03}were careless and let him escape!{02}{00}
Before I knew it, Chaucha stole{03}the keys to the jail, and Briggs{03}and his crew had them.{01}I never looked away! Not once!{03}I never let my guard down!{03}How did this happen?{02}{00}
No matter how many times I go{03}over it, nothing seems right.{03}I'm just not convinced...{01}Wait a sec... Did Eoleo have a{03}hand in this? He was standing{03}behind me the entire time...{02}{00}
The mayor of Alhafra does{03}not wish to meet with you.{03}Please step back.{02}{00}
You really made a mess of{03}things. Letting Briggs get{03}away? What's wrong with you!?{01}The mayor trusted you! You{03}were his favorites{B0}but not{03}anymore!{02}{00}
The mayor was so mad at us{03}for letting Briggs reach the{03}boat.{01}How were we to know he{03}was going to steal it?{02}{00}
One thing's for sure... We're not{03}going to be hearing about how{03}great {11}{05} is anymore!{01}Now it's my turn to show{03}the mayor what I can do!{02}{00}
Briggs came through here and{03}disappeared into the forest.{03}Scared the pants clean off me!{02}{00}
The poor guard was blindfolded{03}when Briggs escaped, so he{03}didn't see a thing.{01}He's smart, that Briggs,{03}covering his escape{03}route like that.{02}{00}
Briggs came back with a{03}giant load of food! I've never{03}been so full! It feels great!{02}{00}
Don't talk to me about food...{03}I feel like I'm gonna be sick.{02}{00}
Let's see them call Champa{03}poor now!{01}Ever since Briggs came back{03}with a cargo of gems, we've{03}been filthy stinking rich!{02}{00}
Hey, you just came to Champa{03}not too long ago, didn't you?{1E}{00}
You'll be pleased to know that{03}Briggs found ancient pirate{03}treasure and bought us all food!{02}{00}
Well, you wouldn't know it to{03}look at us now, but Champa{03}was quite poor until recently.{01}Now, thanks to Briggs, we're{03}all so wealthy, it's disgusting!{02}{00}
Briggs took a long time{03}to return to us. You want{03}to know why?{1E}{00}
He was being held by an evil{03}man who stole his money and{03}made him a prisoner!{01}They were probably trying{03}to find Briggs's jewels...{03}The sea is a rough place.{02}{00}
Briggs overcame great{03}danger to return home to us.{03}I admire him. I really do.{02}{00}
Briggs looks so reliable,{03}so sure of himself. I've never{03}seen him like this before.{02}{00}
Those bags are full of food{03}for the people of Champa.{03}Briggs gave them to us.{02}{00}
I want to play with Eoleo,{03}but he never comes down{03}to the harbor anymore.{02}{00}
Briggs fought the odds to{03}bring us jewels and food!{03}He's an amazing leader!{02}{00}
Obaba is the last possessor of{03}the ancient secrets of Ankhol,{03}a long-lost civilization...{01}There's nothing she can't fix,{03}no matter how broken it is.{03}She's quite the blacksmith!{02}{00}
You'd think Obaba would be{03}glad that Briggs was back.{03}She acts like nothing's changed.{02}{00}
Now, nobody has to do anything{03}he or she doesn't want to do!{03}We owe Briggs a lot of thanks.{02}{00}
Briggs is so generous!{03}He told me to eat and eat{03}and eat, so I did!{02}{00}
Errrrg... I was so full, and I{03}just kept eating. I think I'm{03}going to explode now.{02}{00}
Gosh... How much are all{03}those jewels worth? More{03}than I can figure, I know that.{02}{00}
Things are going to be different{03}around here. Things are going{03}to be better. I can't wait.{02}{00}
We're lucky Briggs hadn't{03}found the jewels when he{03}was caught.{01}That would have been{03}the end of Champa.{02}{00}
Briggs was always such{03}a brat, but now he's saved the{03}village! What a turnaround!{02}{00}
All of our stockhouses are{03}so full of food that they've{03}just left the extra out here...{02}{00}
Eoleo said he couldn't play{03}with us anymore, even though{03}he's younger than we are...{02}{00}
If Champa gets enough money,{03}maybe we can stop with the{03}looting and pillaging...{02}{00}
Is Obaba in a good mood now,{03}or what? I noticed the change{03}as soon as Briggs returned.{01}If you've got something to ask{03}her, now's the time to ask.{02}{00}
Nobody really likes to play the{03}role of a pirate.{01}I'm sure everyone is glad they{03}don't have to anymore.{02}{00}
We don't need to live off{03}fish anymore, so we don't{03}need any fishermen, do we?{01}That does it. I'm not{03}working anymore. What{03}would be the point?{02}{00}
It's true! It's true! Briggs did{03}return with the jewels!{01}He's really going to have more{03}friends than he did before!{02}{00}
Father's acting like a child, and it{03}seems he quit his job. He plans{03}on lounging around at home...{02}{00}
When Briggs returned with the{03}jewels, the adults quit working.{03}I hope I don't become like them.{02}{00}
I'd rather spend my time sleeping{03}than passing it chasing fish that{03}can't be caught.{01}Why go after food, when Briggs{03}can give it to you?{02} {00}
Briggs is a hero for saving the{03}village. But will Father lose his{03}motivation to be productive?{02}{00}
If Father sits around the house, he{03}will lose all respectability. It's{03}better to fish than to do nothing.{02}{00}
Quitting their jobs makes the{03}adults just like us kids. It's{03}getting really weird around here.{02}{00}
I hear that Briggs sold the{03}jewels he found for cash and{03}then acquired a boat.{02}{00}
While I'm grateful for the food,{03}it's somewhat annoying knowing{03}that Briggs saved the day.{02}{00}
Briggs really saved our hides{03}this time, but I'm not about to{03}join his crew!{01}Yeah, maybe I do owe him for{03}this, but I'll find a way to{03}pay him back legitimately.{02}{00}
The nerve of that Briggs!{03}He's gone for a bit, and he{03}comes back in a bigger boat!{01}I'll bet he only did it{03}to show us up, too!{02}{00}
I should just sign up with{03}Briggs's crew and stop all{03}my complaining.{01}Oh, but my shipmates would{03}never forgive me if I bailed{03}on them like that.{02}{00}
I refuse to live in the cliffs, and{03}therefore I am against Briggs.{01}I have accepted his food, but that{03}is as far as I will let myself slip.{02}{00}
I've been wondering about{03}finding a chief for Champa,{03}since we don't have one.{01}If so, then Briggs would be the{03}favorite, since he's given{03}so much to the village.{02}{00}
We village elders have guided{03}Champa for so many years...{01}Yes, times are changing. Perhaps{03}it's time Champa's leadership{03}was given to the sailors.{02}{00}
A new image for Champa will{03}reflect the time we live in...{03}Any new visitors will like it...{02}{00}
Observing Briggs recently,{03}the limits of Champa as a{03}village are very apparent.{01}From now on, the village will{03}develop through trade. I guess{03}that's the era we've come to.{02}{00}
It seems the elders are{03}considering appointing Briggs{03}the first-ever chief of Champa.{02}{00}
I, for one, think a person who can{03}bring the people of Champa{03}together will do us some good.{02}{00}
Sure, Briggs saved the village.{03}But saving it from despair is not{03}the same as governing it...{02}{00}
Supporting an entire village{03}through fishing from the sea{03}is next to impossible.{01}We need new sources of income.{03}Briggs is on the right path, finding{03}us all those lovely jewels.{02} {00}
Whoa! You... You're {11}{05}!{02}{00}
What? Really?{03}It's {11}{05}?{02} {00}
You're awfully persistent,{03}aren't you?{02}{00}
Briggs, get outta here!{03}{11}{05} is here to{03}finish you off!{02}{00}
What was that!?{03}{11}{05}? Here?{02}{00}
Oh no! It's really him! I've{03}got to get out of here!!!{02}{00}
Why do you have to be so{03}stubborn? Quit following{03}us, you big bully!{02} {00}
All right, I surrender! I'll{03}go back to Alhafra...but{03}only if Briggs is going.{02}{00}
I'd rather fight than go{03}back to jail.{03}Bring it on, sissyboy!{02}{00}
Leave the women and{03}children alone. They've{03}got nothing to do with this.{02}{00}
You're {11}{05}, aren't you?{03}You've come to bring in{03}Briggs, haven't you?{02}{00}
Did you really think you could{03}come storming into Champa,{03}Briggs's home, without a fight?{02}{00}
Aw, come on! I'm not doing{03}anything! Leave me alone!{02}{00}
What, you want to come in?{1E}{00}
As if! I'm a nice girl, and I'm{03}not about to let some masher{03}come storming into my room!{02}{00}
Yeah? So what do you want?{03}You're wasting my time.{02}{00}
Why's everyone so scared of{03}you? You don't look so tough.{02}{00}
If you so much as {09}{02}touch{07} me,{03}I'll bite your nose off!{02}{00}
Maybe if I pretend he's not there,{03}he'll go away. I don't want to fight{03}him... He's got creepy powers!{02}{00}
He's after our ship, isn't he?{03}That no-good thief mayor{03}must have sent him.{02}{00}
It would be so much easier just{03}to go back to jail. Yeah... They{03}can't beat me up if I surrender!{02}{00}
What are they doing here?{03}Do they mean to capture us?{02}{00}
Briggs said the guy who{03}captured him was some amazingly{03}tough thug named {11}{05}.{01}But I don't know... If this really{03}is him, he doesn't look like the{03}bad guy Briggs said he was.{02}{00}
Why would Briggs run away{03}like a little baby just because{03}this guy showed up?{02}{00}
Briggs is pretty tough. This guy{03}must be a serious monster if he{03}beat the captain...{02}{00}
Tough or not, he's not getting{03}past me without a beating.{02}{00}
He's not so tough! Why's everyone{03}running away? Just thump him{03}good and be done with it.{02}{00}
What's he staring at? Sheesh!{03}This guy's a total lech!{02}{00}
Hold it right there!{02}{00}
So, {11}{05}, you've come.{02}{00}
Don't assume I'll go so{03}easy on you this time!{02}{00}
Is that boy him? The "mighty{03}warrior" you told me about?{02}{00}
I told you he didn't look{03}like much, Grandma...{02}{00}
Weren't you even{03}listening to me?{02}{00}
All you told me is that his name{03}is {11}{05} and that he is{03}a "mighty warrior." Hmph.{02}{00}
He doesn't look like the sort{03}of person who's interested in{03}stealing our jewels, though.{02}{00}
But that's not the{03}point, Grandma!{02}{00}
If you don't destroy him now,{03}he's going to take me far away,{03}and you won't ever see me again!{02}{00}
Oh, now he doesn't look like the{03}kind of boy who would do that...{02}{00}
If he takes me away, poor{03}Eoleo will be so sad! What{03}do you say about that, huh?{02}{00}
Oh, that's just not fair.{03}You know I can't deny my{03}darling great-grandson!{02}{00}
I don't see why I should be the{03}one to get you out of this mess,{03}but I can't bear to see Eoleo sad.{02}{00}
Grandma, please!{02}{00}
Oh, all right. Listen, you have no{03}idea what you're getting into.{03}I think you'd better leave.{1E}{00}
Ah, you've made a good decision.{03}You seem like a reasonable boy.{03}Reasonable boys live longer.{02}{00}
Stubborn, are you? Ah, well.{03}If that's the way it's going to{03}be, get ready for your medicine!{02}{00}
Heart of the earth, fury of the{03}forge's flames, grant me power!{02}{00}
Have you learned your{03}lesson, {11}{05}?{02}{00}
Ah, such a bright lad. Now then,{03}don't you ever try to take my{03}Briggs away ever again!{02}{00}
Back for more?{02}{00}
I wouldn't be doing this if it{03}weren't for Eoleo, you know.{02}{00}
I'm sorry. You look like quite a{03}nice boy, but I just can't allow{03}you to take my Briggs away.{02}{00}
My salamander! You...{03}beat my salamander...{02}{00}
I thought he was unbeatable...{03}How could this be?{02}{00}
How did you do that?{03}What... What are you?{02}{00}
Grandma, what's going on!?{03}I thought you were going{03}to protect me!{02}{00}
What do you mean, what am I{03}doing? I've done everything I can!{02}{00}
Grandma!!! He's going to take{03}me away! He's a bad guy! You{03}have to do {09}{02}something{07}!{02}{00}
I'm sorry, Briggs, but you'll{03}have to fight him yourself.{02}{00}
Wha-What!?{02}{00}
You heard me. I'm through{03}pampering you. You have to{03}get out of this yourself!{02}{00}
But...Grandma... Look at him!{03}I mean, look what he can do!{02}{00}
I know, dear, but there's nothing{03}I can do to help. You don't want{03}him to take you away, do you?{02}{00}
But...what about poor Eoleo?{02}{00}
*Sigh*{03}All right, all right.{02}{00}
Um. Excuse me... There seems{03}to be a small misunderstanding.{02}{00}
Yeah! I don't like standing here{03}listening to a pirate call {09}{02}us{07}{03}the bad guys!{02}{00}
Pirate! My Briggs?{02}{00}
He stole a ship from Alhafra{03}and escaped from their jail!{03}A ship {09}{02}we{07} helped fix!{02}{00}
Briggs, is this true?{02}{00}
Aw... But, Grandma, they...{02}{00}
We should tell you, we're{03}not here to take Briggs{03}back to Alhafra.{02}{00}
So you've decided you don't{03}want to run errands for the{03}mayor of Alhafra?{1E}{00}
Good. That greedy bag of hot{03}air can do his own dirty work,{03}for all I care.{02}{00}
{11}{05}, I know you can't{03}mean that. We didn't come to{03}Champa for that bloated gasbag.{02}{00}
Briggs... Piracy? Why?{02}{00}
Grandma, it's not what you{03}think! These guys, they...{02}{00}
Briggs, you just hush up!!!{03}{05}...It all makes sense now. The{03}gems, the food, your absence...{02}{00}
What do you mean?{03}What makes sense?{02}{00}
They're telling the truth! And{03}you, Briggs! You've been{03}lying to me this whole time!{02}{00}
You're going to take their word{03}over your own grandson's?{02}{00}
You got that right! I should{03}have known better than to{03}believe you, you scoundrel!{02}{00}
He only did it for Champa!{02}{00}
Chaucha!{02}{00}
You came!{02}{00}
I heard {11}{05} had shown{03}up looking for you. I was{03}worried...{02}{00}
What did you mean, Briggs{03}did it for Champa?{02}{00}
All of that food...{03}Stolen goods?{02}{00}
No, we paid for everthing we{03}brought back with us.{02}{00}
But you stole a boat to{03}do it, didn't you?{02}{00}
Grandma, we found those jewels{03}ourselves, and we paid Alhafra{03}well for that ship, didn't we?{1E}{00}
Your story has the{03}ring of truth to it.{02}{00}
Thank you, {11}{05}. Your{03}honesty speaks well of you.{02}{00}
So he's lying again?{02}{00}
Dang it, {11}{05}, I'm{03}not lying!{02}{00}
We...were pirates, for a short{03}while. Until we found the jewels.{02}{00}
But if not for our efforts,{03}Champa would have starved{03}away long ago.{02}{00}
But that doesn't excuse{03}resorting to piracy!{02}{00}
Hey, it's not like we were{03}doing it for the money! We{03}wanted to save Champa!{02}{00}
Those jewels we found are very{03}valuable. We intend to repay{03}each town we...borrowed from.{02}{00}
Isn't that true?{02}{00}
What's the matter with you!?{03}You said on the boat that we{03}would repay every last town!{02}{00}
Oh yeah... You're right...{03}We really ought to try to make{03}amends for what we've done.{02}{00}
That's the truth, Grandmother.{03}Can you find it in your heart{03}to forgive your only grandson?{02}{00}
All right, all right. I'm too old for{03}grudges. But what about {11}{05}?{02}{00}
What do you say, {11}{05}?{03}Can you forgive my husband?{1E}{00}
I agree, {11}{05}. If each{03}town is repaid what was stolen,{03}I see no reason for complaint.{02}{00}
I don't know, {11}{05}.{03}We didn't come to capture{03}Briggs. Why should we care?{02}{00}
Do you hear that? They forgive{03}you, too. That means you can{03}leave Eoleo with nothing to fear.{02}{00}
I... I don't know what to say...{02}{00}
You know, you look a{03}little strange...{02}{00}
Oh... Oh, really?{02}{00}
You haven't caught a{03}cold, have you? Do you{03}have a fever?{02}{00}
What are you talking about?{02}{00}
No, I'm positive... You look{03}flush, too... You'd better lie{03}down before it gets worse.{02}{00}
She...worries about me.{02}{00}
Hurry up and get into bed{03}so you can get some rest!{02}{00}
Oh, for goodness' sake! You{03}don't want to give them your{03}cold, do you? Come on!{02}{00}
So...what brings you{03}to Champa?{02}{00}
I mean, you didn't come here{03}to catch Briggs, from what{03}I gathered...{02}{00}
Ah, well... To be young and{03}foolish again.{01}If you ever need to consult with{03}me on any number of subjects,{03}you're welcome anytime.{02}{00}
I mean it. If there's ever{03}anything you need, just{03}call on me. I'm always here.{02}{00}
Now I've done it. I said I'd help{03}them with anything, but I'm only{03}good at fixing broken things...{02}{00}
This looks like a weapon!{02}{00}
It looks like part of a trident,{03}but it's only one third of the{03}whole thing, it seems...{02}{00}
Why... Could it be? Is this{03}the legendary trident of{03}Ankohl?{02}{00}
I'll hold on to this for you. It{03}won't do you any good like{03}this, and I'll keep it safe here.{02}{00}
You seem unsure... You don't{03}think I'll pull a fast one on you,{03}do you?{1E}{00}
Kids today. So mistrustful.{02}{00}
Ah, that's nice.{03}Don't you worry!{02}{00}
If you bring me the other{03}two pieces, I'll be happy{03}to rebuild it for you.{02}{00}
The legend says that anyone{03}who holds the whole lance has{03}nothing to fear from the sea.{02}{00}
All of my smithing knowledge and{03}training was solely so that I might{03}rebuild the legendary trident.{01}I can't wait to get all three{03}pieces and repair the ancient{03}weapon of Ankohl.{02}{00}
Ah, have you found the{03}second piece, dear?{02}{00}
It's magnificent!{02}{00}
I'll hold on to this as well.{03}Wouldn't want it getting lost,{03}now would we? Only one to go!{02}{00}
Yes, there's no doubt about it.{03}Those must truly be fragments{03}of the legendary trident.{02}{00}
Soon, I'll have the chance to{03}test my skills to their fullest{03}extent! I can hardly wait!{02}{00}
Well done! You found all{03}three pieces of the trident!{02}{00}
That means I can begin{03}work reforging the ancient{03}trident of Ankohl! At last!{02}{00}
We'll just toss all three{03}pieces in here, shall we?{1E}{00}
Just leave it to me...{02}{00}
There's nothing to be afraid{03}of, dear. Just leave it to me.{02}{00}
Heart of the earth, fury of the{03}forge's flames, grant me power!{02}{00}
That's funny... Nothing happened.{02}{00}
What's going on?{02}{00}
Something's happening!{03}Is that...the legendary trident?{02}{00}
After all these years, the trident{03}is complete again. But what's{03}making it float like that?{02}{00}
Regardless, the trident has{03}been fixed. It belongs to you{03}now, {11}{05}. Use it well.{02}{00}
The trident seems to have some{03}amazing power... The legends{03}must be true...{01}No matter what you encounter{03}at sea, no monster can stand{03}against you with that trident.{02}{00}
You guys don't look much like{03}warriors, but you sure are{03}brave to fight your way in here.{02}{00}
Why did you have to go and tell{03}Obaba that we were pirates?{03}I'll bet that really upset her.{02}{00}
Aren't you the ones who caught{03}Briggs in Alhafra? You don't{03}look it, but you're pretty tough.{02}{00}
When Briggs set sail, we{03}thought we'd never see him{03}again.{01}Now, all of a sudden, he shows{03}up, and with enough food to{03}save our town forever!{02}{00}
I think those guys down in{03}the harbor wanted to come{03}up here and join us...{01}All they have to do is ask,{03}but I think they're chicken...{02}{00}
We have so much food{03}everywhere now!{01}I hope Briggs goes off{03}soon to bring us even{03}more jewels and treats!{02}{00}
Briggs came down with a{03}cold. I guess that means he{03}won't be sailing for a while.{02}{00}
Eoleo still won't come down{03}and play with us. I'm getting{03}really cheesed off at him.{02}{00}
Once I'm over my cold, I'm setting{03}out to get more jewels and make{03}amends with Madra and Daila.{02}{00}
I wonder what's wrong with{03}Briggs. He was feeling so{03}healthy and happy.{01}He doesn't have a fever, and{03}he's not coughing, but he says{03}he's too weak to go out.{02}{00}
Babu ba bubabu...{02}{00}
We're going to wait until{03}Briggs feels better before{03}we go out to sea again.{02}{00}
There were plenty of treasures{03}on that island in the middle of{03}the sea.{01}If we get tired of waiting{03}for Briggs, maybe you{03}could come with us.{02}{00}
We really want to make{03}amends. We just need{03}Briggs to get better.{02}{00}
It's all my fault. If I hadn't{03}messed with that switch,{03}we'd have gotten everything.{02}{00}
All of my training was for the{03}single purpose of reforging{03}the ancient trident.{02}{00}
{11}{05} must be incredibly{03}strong to get Briggs all{03}worked up like that.{02}{00}
I just know she's going to{03}yell at us. The waiting is the{03}worst part. Next to the yelling.{02}{00}
That {11}{05} sure comes off{03}kind of high and mighty. I hate{03}those self-righteous types.{02}{00}
I was just gazing out at sea,{03}and then I saw Briggs's{03}ship... I got all choked up.{02}{00}
All those sailors who didn't{03}join Briggs said they didn't{03}want to be pirates.{01}Now that Briggs's going{03}straight, they want to join him.{03}I think they're just cowards.{02}{00}
Briggs says he's sick and{03}can't go to sea right now.{01}But how can he not go? He{03}has to make up for all of{03}his evil deeds...{02}{00}
Briggs's never been sick{03}a day in his life. I wonder how{03}he caught a cold now...{02}{00}
Eoleo is younger than I am,{03}but he acts like he's a lot{03}older.{02}{00}
I'm certain that there are{03}even more jewels back in{03}that cave!{01}If only I'd had the chance to{03}grab a few more before that{03}trap blocked our way!{02}{00}
There is absolutely nothing{03}wrong with Briggs.{01}I just know he's hiding{03}something from me...{02}{00}
One of Papa's men touched a{03}trap, and that's why Papa{03}couldn't get all the jewels.{01}Papa, I think you should{03}tell {11}{05} about that.{02}{00}
Suppose we went to get the{03}jewels... How would we gather{03}them, with that trap in the way?{02}{00}
Briggs is just pretending to{03}be sick because he doesn't{03}want to follow up on his promise.{02}{00}
I was as shocked as the next{03}guy that we couldn't reach{03}those treasure chests...{02}{00}
At least we got some of{03}the jewels before that stupid{03}switch blocked us off.{02}{00}
The jewels Briggs found{03}are truly remarkable.{01}I wonder if there are any{03}more like these in that cave.{02}{00}
Thanks to Briggs, the Champa{03}can eat again!{01}Unfortunately, all that food is{03}going to run out someday.{03}Then, what do we do?{02}{00}
Briggs's men said they found{03}amazing weapons and things{03}in the cave, too...{01}I wish I'd been there. I would{03}like to have seen them...{02}{00}
Now's the time we ought to{03}be working hardest. While we{03}can eat, Champa can flourish.{02}{00}
We still haven't been able{03}to catch any fish for dinner.{01}Not to worry, though. We'll{03}serve up the meat that{03}Briggs bought for us!{02}{00}
It's nice not having to{03}work, but it gets a little{03}boring after a while.{02}{00}
Most people here would love{03}a nice fish meal, but having{03}red meat is a nice change.{02}{00}
The only way to find your{03}special purpose in life{03}is to work hard.{02}{00}
Briggs's jewels have turned{03}this poor town into a wealthy{03}place, but he brought too many.{01}Now, the hardworking people of{03}Champa have learned to be{03}lazy louts.{02}{00}
All the people in town think{03}they can live without ever{03}having to work again.{01}They've quit their jobs,{03}and they rely too heavily{03}on Briggs's find.{02}{00}
Hold on to that tiller!{03}Do you want us to get{03}swallowed by the waves!?{02}{00}
I know you're worried,{03}{11}{07}, but he's doing{03}the best he can...{02}{00}
That was an incredibly strong{03}whirlpool, but I doubt it could{03}sink us or destroy the ship.{02}{00}
See, {11}{07}? There's nothing to{03}worry about. Even if we hit a{03}whirlpool, we should be fine.{02}{00}
But still... {11}{08}, can't you show{03}{11}{05} how to get past the{03}whirlpools and into Lemuria?{02}{00}
Er, yes, well...{02}{00}
What's wrong, {11}{08}?{03}Lemuria's just beyond these{03}whirlpools, isn't it?{02}{00}
Yeah, I...think so...{02}{00}
You..."think so"!?{02}{00}
Aren't you...{09}{02}from{07} Lemuria?{03}Shouldn't you know exactly{03}where it is?{02}{00}
Yes, I'm from Lemuria... I've{03}never had to get back {09}{02}into{07}{03}it before!{01}And besides, the tidal wave{03}carried me out of Lemuria.{03}I didn't come through here.{02}{00}
Oh, I see. So that must mean...{03}You don't actually know which{03}direction Lemuria is in, do you?{02}{00}
Don't be silly! I mean...{03}I just need to get my bearings.{02}{00}
Hm... That doesn't sound good.{02}{00}
If Lemuria really is beyond those{03}currents, then we'll need to find{03}a way to get through them.{02}{00}
And until we do...{02}{00}
We won't be getting into Lemuria.{02}{00}
Why, that was Psynergy,{03}wasn't it?{02}{00}
Are they Adepts?{02}{00}
Who {09}{02}are{07} you!?{02}{00}
Are you the ones who{03}defeated Poseidon?{1E}{00}
That's quite something! Who{03}are you, that you could{03}defeat that leviathan?{02}{00}
But clearly, you are here,{03}and the beast is gone...{02}{00}
If you are strong enough to{03}defeat Poseidon, you are too{03}dangerous to enter Lemuria.{02}{00}
The king's orders are clear!{03}We cannot grant you entry.{02}{00}
King? Who is your king?{02}{00}
His Highness, King Hydros,{03}of course...{02}{00}
His Majesty has ruled over{03}Lemuria for centuries.{02}{00}
King Hydros has decreed that{03}Lemuria must be kept safe{03}from dangerous outsiders.{02}{00}
You say that we are dangerous,{03}but do you include me as well?{02}{00}
{11}{08}!{1E}{00}
{11}{08}!{02}{00}
Did you join them in battle{03}against Poseidon?{02}{00}
Impossible! Everyone knows{03}you possess great courage, but{03}you still are a mere Lemurian!{02}{00}
Such comments do us all a{03}great disservice! I battled{03}fiercely alongside my friends!{02}{00}
Leave our landing to me.{02}{00}
You have my word that we{03}shall create no problems{03}during our stay.{01}Will you not permit us to enter?{02}{00}
{11}{08}, I know you are a{03}man of your word, but the king's{03}orders must stand!{02}{00}
You understand that we cannot{03}simply ignore the king's orders,{03}don't you, {11}{08}?{02}{00}
What is King Hydros doing...{02}{00}
So, you people really take your{03}kings seriously, don't you?{02}{00}
Insolent pup! Do not dishonor{03}the king of Lemuria! We are{03}peaceful, but quick to anger!{02}{00}
Pup? I must be twice your{03}age! Who are you calling{03}"pup"?{02}{00}
You wish to see Lemuria, and yet{03}you know so little of us! I am far{03}older than you. Show respect!{02}{00}
Pah! Older than me?!{03}Inconceivable!{02}{00}
Er... Actually, Kraden, these{03}two are perhaps older than{03}all of you combined...{02}{00}
Babi must have spoken of this{03}to you. In Lemuria, time passes{03}quite slowly.{02}{00}
Ah... Well... I suppose I recall{03}something of that sort or{03}another... Maybe...{01}But to imagine for a moment{03}that these two gentlemen are{03}older than I am? It's a bit much!{02}{00}
But perhaps I was rude, and{03}I hope you accept my apology.{03}My ignorance misled me.{02}{00}
Well, just so long as we're{03}clear on that.{02}{00}
But if your fighting is as skilled{03}as your wordplay, then perhaps{03}you aren't so dangerous to us.{02}{00}
I agree. Perhaps His Majesty{03}will provide an exception in{03}their case.{02}{00}
King Hydros might be willing{03}to reverse his order if we{03}confer with him, wouldn't he?{02}{00}
We shall speak with{03}him at once!{02}{00}
King Hydros has been seeking{03}news from beyond the Sea of{03}Time. He will want to see you.{02}{00}
Wait here.{02}{00}
How long do you think{03}we'll be waiting?{02}{00}
Good point. Time means little{03}to most Lemurians.{01}Mere moments to us could{03}seem like a lifetime to outsiders.{02}{00}
You seem young to me, and{03}yet you are probably an old{03}man among your people...{01}I would imagine that you have{03}probably done enough waiting{03}in your lifetime.{02}{00}
King Hydros instructed us to be{03}kind to the elderly at all times.{02}{00}
They seem trustworthy enough...{03}Shall we let them in?{02}{00}
I can see no reason not to.{03}We won't get in trouble, will we?{02}{00}
I will be with them! Now,{03}please, let me walk the streets{03}of my home once more!{02}{00}
I beseech you!{02}{00}
Then we place our trust in{03}each of you. You may enter.{03}But...don't do anything rash!{02}{00}
If you cause any trouble, we'll{03}hunt you down and exact{03}swift and terrible vengeance.{02}{00}
Do we have your word?{1E}{00}
Ooo! Ooo! Finally! What could{03}be waiting for me in Lemuria?{03}I can't wait another moment!{02}{00}
We've come a long way{03}to see Lemuria. I won't have{03}anything ruin it for me now!{02}{00}
But thank you for speaking{03}honestly. Sometimes, you can{03}say the weirdest things...{01}I was actually a little bit{03}worried, to tell you truly.{02}{00}
What!? Are you INSANE!? Or{03}maybe you think you're funny?{03}Because you're not!{01}Maybe this whole quest is{03}just a game to you, but it's{03}not to me! Are you bored!?{01}Do you want to go home!?{03}FINE! That's it! Then let's{03}go home!{02}{00}
Oh, hush. I'll keep a close{03}eye on them. You have{03}nothing to fear.{02}{00}
Very well, {11}{08}. We place{03}our faith in you, then.{03}Enter freely and peacably.{02}{00}
You must already be aware of{03}this, but you are not permitted{03}to enter the palace.{02}{00}
If the king were to find out about{03}this, we'd be in big trouble.{02}{00}
Don't worry! I won't let{03}that happen.{02}{00}
Is this Hydros really{03}so fearsome?{02}{00}
Fearsome isn't the right word...{03}King Hydros has lived longer{03}than anyone. He is most wise.{02}{00}
While everyone respects{03}him and holds him in great{03}reverence...{01}It would be a mistake to{03}call it fear.{02}{00}
I certainly do not fear him.{03}The king... He...{02}{00}
He what?{02}{00}
You will understand once you{03}meet the king yourself.{02}{00}
But that does not matter{03}now. Let's go!{02}{00}
To Lemuria... The city you've{03}all been longing to see...{02}{00}
Lost already, {11}{05}? That's{03}the way to the boat dock! You{03}can't want to return already!{01}We've only just gotten to{03}Lemuria. We can't leave yet!{03}There's still so much to see!{02}{00}
Lost already, {11}{05}? That's{03}the way to the boat dock! You{03}can't want to return already!{01}We've only just gotten to{03}Lemuria. We can't leave yet!{03}There's still so much to see!{02}{00}
This place is remarkable...{03}Truly remarkable...{02}{00}
Who goes there! I've not{03}seen you in Lemuria before!{02}{00}
Wait a moment...{02}{00}
You must be the travelers{03}who arrived with {11}{08}. Is{03}your name {11}{05}, perchance?{02}{00}
{11}{08}?{03}You mean {11}{08},{03}the Lost One?{02}{00}
Have I earned a title in my{03}absence? Well, worry not!{03}{11}{08} is lost no more!{02}{00}
I seek counsel with King Hydros.{03}Has His Highness been{03}told of my return?{02}{00}
Word was sent, but I do not{03}know if it has reached the king.{02}{00}
What do you mean?{02}{00}
Lord Conservato is meeting{03}with His Highness as we speak.{02}{00}
Not Conservato...{02}{00}
What's wrong, {11}{08}? You{03}don't look pleased to hear{03}that name...{02}{00}
Kraden... What do you think of{03}what you have seen of Lemuria?{02}{00}
It is a magnificent city!{03}Or do you mean the castle?{03}Both are magnificent!{02}{00}
And you, {11}{05}?{03}Do you agree?{1E}{00}
Any newcomer to our town{03}would doubtless feel the{03}same at first.{02}{00}
Ah! Yes, you marvel not at its{03}present condition, but at the{03}greater splendor of its past!{02}{00}
In ages past, Lemuria was a{03}far lovelier, more grand, and{03}more lively city.{02}{00}
His Highness, the king, tells of{03}days gone by, of a more brilliant{03}Lemuria long before my birth.{02}{00}
Over the countless years,{03}our people have lost vigor,{03}enthusiasm, creativity...{01}Lemuria has fallen into{03}slow collapse, a city that{03}has lost its spark...{02}{00}
Lemuria as you see it{03}is only a shadow of the{03}city of legend.{02}{00}
If only I had the chance to see{03}the city in all its splendor. But{03}how does Conservato figure in?{02}{00}
King Hydros believes that our{03}decay is related in some way{03}to Alchemy.{02}{00}
Alchemy!?{02}{00}
King Hydros wants to find a{03}way to stop the ruin of{03}Lemuria.{02}{00}
If there were anything we{03}could do to help stop it,{03}we would.{02}{00}
But the senators are unwilling{03}to take action! They're stubborn,{03}and they fear any change...{02}{00}
Senate? What is a senate?{02}{00}
The senate is the group of{03}elders who determine policy{03}in Lemuria.{02}{00}
Lord Conservato holds the{03}highest office in the senate.{02}{00}
The senate usually opposes{03}any new ideas or proposals{03}introduced before it...{02}{00}
Word of our arrival will never{03}reach the king as long as{03}Conservato has his ear.{02}{00}
And his conversations with the{03}king are incredibly long.{02}{00}
We have no choice but{03}to wait patiently here.{02}{00}
Why don't we spend our{03}time looking around Lemuria{03}until then...{02}{00}
The king is holding counsel with{03}Lord Conservato right now.{01}It might be a while before{03}you can see him.{02}{00}
The king will be thrilled to hear{03}his trusted {11}{08} has{03}returned.{02}{00}
How much longer will Conservato{03}be in there? They've been talking{03}for ages now.{02}{00}
I had heard {11}{08} was{03}back, but I didn't believe it until{03}now...{01}You seem much more confident,{03}{11}{08}. Everyone has been{03}noticing it.{02}{00}
I cannot remember the last{03}time we had visitors in Lemuria.{03}Not in a great while, certainly.{02}{00}
Lemuria has no disease, no{03}war... Anyone who saw it would{03}think it a paradise.{01}And yet...all who come to our{03}city seek to leave soon after{03}arriving. I, too, wish to leave.{02}{00}
In Lemuria, we do not grow old.{03}It must seem quite odd to{03}those from the outside world.{02}{00}
Life never changes here in{03}Lemuria. It can get rather{03}dull, you'll find.{02}{00}
I ought to feel surprised to{03}see outsiders here, but I can't{03}remember how to be surprised.{02}{00}
How old am I again? I quit{03}counting after I turned two{03}hundred, and that was long ago.{02}{00}
It has been many, many years{03}since a new child was born{03}in Lemuria.{01}Lemurians love children, but{03}they only remain children for{03}such a short time.{02}{00}
We are the only children in{03}Lemuria. I often wish there were{03}other children to play with.{02}{00}
Meow... Mrrrfle...{02}{00}
Woof! ...rrrrrROOF!{02}{00}
Moo.{02}{00}
Bukbukbuk...{02}{00}
...{02}{00}
More of the same, today and{03}every day. Nothing around{03}here ever changes.{02}{00}
I haven't been surprised in{03}ages. I don't know what I'd{03}do if something happened.{02}{00}
I've aged so slowly, I no longer{03}fear death, but at the same time,{03}I have no motivation at all.{02}{00}
Sometimes, I think the buildings{03}fall apart faster than we age.{02}{00}
Long ago, a man named Lunpa{03}drifted to our island. That was{03}quite a surprise.{01}Someone else came with him,{03}but he fled so quickly.{03}What was his name again?{02}{00}
King Hydros is far older{03}even than I am...{03}How old is he?{02}{00}
Everyone spoils me so much...{03}I don't ever want to grow up!{01}But in another 20 or 30 years,{03}I will be an adult. Oh well. At{03}least it's some kind of change.{02}{00}
Are there other children in the{03}lands beyond the Sea of Time?{03}Are there other people?{02}{00}
No one in Lemuria feels any{03}passion for anything. They're{03}lazier than a cat in a sunbeam.{02}{00}
There's so much treasure buried{03}here that you could dig almost{03}anywhere and find something...{01}So why doesn't anybody{03}here dig?{02}{00}
Lemurians are so lazy that{03}they make me look like a{03}dynamo. And they live so long!{02}{00}
If it weren't for the people in{03}the castle, the Lemurians would{03}probably let themselves starve.{02}{00}
Mother... Why have you{03}left me...{02}{00}
I have never been outside of{03}Lemuria. I don't know what the{03}rest of the world is like.{01}If there weren't laws prohibiting{03}us from leaving, I would be gone{03}in an instant.{02}{00}
Now that {11}{08} has returned,{03}maybe he'll share his tales{03}of the outside world with me.{02}{00}
Who knows what wonders lie{03}across the Sea of Time... I'd{03}love to know, but...{01}I can't stand places with{03}little culture and no advanced{03}civilization.{02}{00}
The senate passed the law that{03}prohibits us from leaving...{01}But {11}{08} was carried out{03}to sea by the tidal wave. He{03}can't be blamed for that...{02}{00}
Are you the travelers that came{03}here with {11}{08}?{1E}{00}
No? Ah, interesting. I wonder{03}when {11}{08} will come to{03}see me.{02}{00}
I was{B0}what is the word?{B0}{03}surprised when I heard{03}{11}{08} had returned.{01}I hope that I get to{03}see him soon.{02}{00}
I am sorry it has taken{03}me so long to visit, Uncle.{02}{00}
{11}{08}! You are alive!{02}{00}
Yes, I've managed to survive{03}against a great many trials.{02}{00}
What a fascinating coincidence!{01}We've stumbled across {11}{08}'s{03}uncle's house!{02}{00}
I must thank you all for{03}looking after my nephew.{02}{00}
This is {11}{05} and Kraden.{03}They are my friends, and{03}have aided me tremendously.{02}{00}
If my sister could only hear{03}how timid young {11}{08}{03}has become a mighty warrior...{02}{00}
Where is my mother? We've been{03}so busy since we arrived that I{03}haven't had a chance to see her.{02}{00}
Now that I think about it, this{03}place is a mess. What happened?{03}Mother is always so neat...{02}{00}
...No! She hasn't...fallen ill{03}again, has she?{02}{00}
There is still illness{03}in Lemuria?{02}{00}
My mother was born with{03}a weak heart...{02}{00}
{11}{08}... I'm sorry... Your return{03}comes too late...{02}{00}
After the tidal wave washed{03}you to sea, your mother{03}suddenly fell ill...{02}{00}
The shock of losing you was{03}too great for her poor heart.{02}{00}
She held out hope for your{03}safe return until the very end.{02}{00}
Perhaps your mother gave{03}herself up to ensure your{03}survival...{02}{00}
Does that not sound like{03}your mother?{02}{00}
Where is she now?{02}{00}
She rests in the cemetery now.{03}Check the headstones... You{03}will find her.{02}{00}
What should we do, {11}{05}?{03}Should we follow {11}{08}?{1E}{00}
After all we've been through,{03}the least we can do is offer{03}{11}{08} our condolences.{02}{00}
You're right. {11}{08} probably{03}needs some time alone right now.{02}{00}
I am so relieved that {11}{08}{03}has returned to me alive.{01}He is the last of my relatives.{03}Without him, I would be alone.{02}{00}
Poor {11}{08}...{03}Being born in Lemuria and{03}gifted with long life...{01}Only to lose his father in his youth{03}and his mother now. He faces{03}many long years of loneliness.{02}{00}
Wait...{02}{00}
I ask that you leave {11}{08}{03}to his mourning for now...{02}{00}
Now he is struggling with{03}the loss of his mother.{03}He needs time.{02}{00}
You came to Lemuria to learn{03}more of Alchemy, did you not?{02}{00}
I suspected as much. {11}{08}{03}was right to bring you here.{02}{00}
{11}{08} told me his secret...{03}The mission he was given{03}by His Highness the king.{02}{00}
Even had the tidal wave not{03}carried {11}{08} off, he would{03}have left us... Such was his fate.{02}{00}
You look confused...{03}{11}{08} told you about{03}this, did he not?{1E}{00}
Of course... He must trust{03}you a great deal.{02}{00}
Curious... I can't understand{03}why he would do that...{02}{00}
If Lord Conservato had not led{03}the senate to oppose him,{03}he would have left sooner.{02}{00}
I wonder what news {11}{08}{03}has brought with him.{02}{00}
Either way, I do know why{03}he has brought you here.{02}{00}
{11}{05}... Don't tell me that{03}he hasn't at least told you{03}that much!{1E}{00}
You say he's told you, but{03}you look rather confused.{02}{00}
Did {11}{08} tell you nothing{03}before bringing you here{03}to Lemuria?{02}{00}
Unfortunately, I know little{03}more than that...{02}{00}
While {11}{08} confronts his{03}sorrow over the loss of his{03}mother, you have some time...{02}{00}
I shall write you a letter...{02}{00}
So that you can see Lunpa...{02}{00}
Lunpa has locked himself in his{03}tower and rarely comes out, but{03}if I send him this, he will see you.{02}{00}
All I need is a bird to carry{03}it to him in his tower.{02}{00}
There. You should be able{03}to see him now.{02}{00}
Go to Lunpa's tower. He{03}will see you.{02}{00}
Lunpa has given the king{03}tremendous aid on this matter.{03}He will have much to tell them.{02}{00}
House of the Senate{02}{00}
Are you the warriors from{03}beyond the Sea of Time who{03}returned with {11}{08}?{1E}{00}
What can you uncivilized louts{03}hope to bring to Lemuria?{02}{00}
Only savages and barbarians are{03}wont to tell lies when confronted{03}with uncomfortable situations.{02}{00}
Long ago, the power of Alchemy{03}was abused in ways that might{03}bring about the end of the world.{01}Because it was sealed away, the{03}king claims, the world has begun{03}to wither and decay.{02}{00}
And now, rumors abound of a{03}group of fools who are actually{03}attempting to restore Alchemy.{01}It is only because Alchemy{03}was sealed away that the world{03}has enjoyed this lasting peace.{02}{00}
Come what may, I cannot{03}approve of anyone setting{03}Alchemy loose on the world.{02}{00}
Has Lemuria fallen into decay,{03}I ask you!? Nay!{01}Only by casting aside Alchemy{03}has the world been saved{03}from itself!{02}{00}
Do you seek to know more{03}about the draughts that provide{03}us with such longevity?{1E}{00}
Once, Lemurians bottled special{03}draughts to leave here and{03}travel through Weyard...{01}A man named Babi stole{03}the remainder of our precious{03}draughts and fled Lemuria.{02}{00}
Then I shall tell you this:{03}So long as we drink of the{03}Lemurian Spring, we live long.{01}We no longer leave our home,{03}so we have no need to make{03}our draughts of old.{02}{00}
Was that some form{03}of Psynergy?{1E}{00}
Ho ho ho! We Lemurians are{03}masters of Psynergy all! Your{03}powers are not special here.{02}{00}
No? Curious. But it does not{03}matter. Lemurians are masters{03}of Psynergy. It is of no import.{02}{00}
What does Hydros think will{03}happen if he sets Alchemy{03}loose on the world again!?{02}{00}
Ever since Alchemy was sealed,{03}time itself has seemed frozen.{01}In my mind's eye, I do not{03}see anyone who will go along{03}with the king's plan.{02}{00}
If Alchemy were loosed upon the{03}world, people would fight again{03}to control the Stone of Sages.{01}Alchemy must remain sealed{03}away, if for no other reason{03}than to avoid this strife.{02}{00}
All of the members of the{03}senate must remain opposed{03}to breaking the seal.{01}As long as we remain united,{03}King Hydros cannot take any{03}action to complete his plan.{02}{00}
Certainly, Lemuria has lost{03}some of the splendor that{03}once filled its streets.{01}But to think that Alchemy{03}could restore this is{03}madness itself!{02}{00}
Even though we no longer{03}prepare the draught, the water{03}of our spring sustains us...{02}{00}
The door doesn't want to open.{02}{00}
Are you kids {11}{08}'s{03}traveling companions?{02}{00}
The door's broken,{03}I'm afraid.{02}{00}
But I opened up a window{03}just above the door.{02}{00}
Sorry about this, but you'll{03}have to climb through there.{02}{00}
Honestly, I'm amazed that{03}anyone can travel so far{03}across the world in this age.{02}{00}
Say, {11}{08} isn't with{03}you! Er...why not?{02}{00}
His mother passed away...{03}He's gone to visit her grave.{02}{00}
Of course... His mother... He{03}loved her dearly. A terrible{03}loss... It must be hard on him.{02}{00}
Well, {11}{08} may not be here, but{03}we still have much to discuss.{02}{00}
If {11}{08} brought you,{03}you must be working to break{03}the seal on Alchemy, right?{1E}{00}
Ah, {11}{08} has done quite{03}well in finding you!{02}{00}
That doesn't make sense... He{03}wouldn't have brought you to{03}Lemuria if you weren't helping.{02}{00}
What mission could the good{03}King Hydros have assigned{03}to {11}{08}?{02}{00}
What? {11}{08} has told you{03}nothing of his mission?{02}{00}
...Really?{02}{00}
So you actually have nothing{03}at all to do with Alchemy!?{02}{00}
Our parents were kidnapped by{03}the Fire Clan, far to the north.{01}We are only firing the lighthouse{03}beacons to gain their freedom...{02}{00}
King Hydros told me that Venus{03}and Mercury have been ignited{03}once again. Was that your doing?{02}{00}
I'm afraid I know nothing of{03}any northern "Fire Clan."{02}{00}
But that doesn't explain you, sir.{03}You're clearly not related to{03}these two. What are your goals?{02}{00}
Kraden joined us on this quest{03}on behalf of Lord Babi of Tolbi.{02}{00}
...Babi?{02}{00}
I only know of one man named{03}Babi... But it couldn't...{02}{00}
Master Lunpa, the Babi we{03}speak of is the same man{03}you knew long ago.{02}{00}
Ah! So...he's still out there,{03}living in the outside world?{02}{00}
Well, that might not be the{03}most accurate way of putting it.{02}{00}
Most...accurate? My, you{03}certainly have an odd way{03}of turning a phrase...{02}{00}
He was living, yes...{03}Until recently, that is...{02}{00}
So, Babi passed away...{03}But only recently, you say?{02}{00}
When he finally ran out of{03}his mystic draughts, his spirit{03}began to wane.{02}{00}
Then...I no longer know anyone{03}in the world outside.{02}{00}
But... Aren't you Lunpa, the{03}Righteous Thief?{02}{00}
I was called that once, long,{03}long ago. Why do you ask?{02}{00}
I'll bet there's at least one{03}person in the outside world{03}whom you still know.{02}{00}
Who would that be?{02}{00}
There's a town called Lunpa{03}in northern Angara. A man{03}named Donpa lives there.{02}{00}
I settled that village! And{03}Donpa... He is my son...{02}{00}
Now, your grandson, Dodonpa,{03}rules over your village.{02}{00}
Rules? Rules is an ill-{03}sounding word.{02}{00}
But it's an accurate one, Lunpa.{03}Dodonpa is an evil thief, who has{03}caused much trouble in Angara.{02}{00}
What has become of my son?{03}How could he permit such{03}a thing to happen?{02}{00}
Master Lunpa, don't you have any{03}idea how old Donpa is?{02}{00}
He is as I am. An old man...{03}He may be older even than I.{02}{00}
If this news outrages you,{03}why don't you go and set{03}Dodonpa straight?{02}{00}
If only I could...{02}{00}
Is this the only reason we're{03}here? To bring news of the{03}outside world?{1E}{00}
You are kind, {11}{05}, but{03}there are much more important{03}matters at hand.{02}{00}
Yes, yes... I am sorry we were{03}sidetracked. We have much{03}more to discuss...{02}{00}
But before we begin, there is{03}one thing I must say...{02}{00}
You don't mind, do{03}you, {11}{05}?{1E}{00}
Clearly, your judgment on this{03}matter is fogged, {11}{05}.{03}I must speak.{02}{00}
I knew you'd agree.{02}{00}
I have discussed this with{03}none but {11}{05}, but...I have{03}my own reasons for this quest.{02}{00}
What do you mean?{02}{00}
Only that I have my own{03}reasons for wanting to see{03}the beacons lit again...{02}{00}
Why are you telling us{03}all of this now?{02}{00}
Because I feel this quest{03}is deeply linked to Lemuria.{02}{00}
I thought it odd that Lord Babi{03}should order me to research{03}Alchemy.{02}{00}
Hey, wait a minute... Is this{03}what you promised to tell us{03}once we reached Lemuria?{02}{00}
Yes, yes... May I continue?{02}{00}
Long ago, before Alchemy's{03}power was sealed...{01}There were many civilizations{03}as advanced and cultivated{03}as Lemuria.{02}{00}
At the moment that Alchemy{03}was sealed away, most of those{03}civilizations began to wane...{01}Until eventually, they vanished.{02}{00}
I have formed certain theories{03}now, suggesting that this may{03}be related to the seal on Alchemy.{02}{00}
Let me get this straight...{03}You felt you couldn't tell us{03}this until we were in Lemuria?{02}{00}
And you only wanted to come{03}to Lemuria to test your theories{03}and see if they were true...{02}{00}
But even if everything you{03}said {09}{02}is{07} true, what does{03}it all mean?{02}{00}
If your theories are correct,{03}the world itself will wane and{03}vanish... Won't it, Kraden?{02}{00}
{11}{08} never spoke of{03}this to you, did he?{02}{00}
If you came to this theory{03}on your own, you are indeed{03}a wise scholar.{01}We would do well to trust you.{02}{00}
What do you mean?{02}{00}
King Hydros and I, as well as{03}others in Lemuria, hold the same{03}beliefs that you do, Kraden.{02}{00}
You do!?!{02}{00}
Civilizations thrive by building{03}upon the knowledge of the past.{02}{00}
Knowledge gained in one{03}generation should be taken{03}even further by the next.{01}Thus, knowledge and learning{03}continue to grow. This is the{03}natural course of civilization.{02}{00}
But where is the world today?{02}{00}
The great civilizations of old have{03}all withered and vanished. We{03}are all isolated and alone.{02}{00}
You have encountered many{03}cultures in your travels.{01}Are any of them capable of{03}building the great sanctums{03}and lighthouses you have seen?{02}{00}
No, they are not... But this{03}is not the only sign of the{03}decay you have theorized...{02}{00}
I think it best that you hear{03}the rest directly from His{03}Majesty, King Hydros.{02}{00}
Yes, Kraden! We shall go{03}to visit the king!{02}{00}
Ah, but King Hydros is in{03}counsel with Lord Conservato.{03}We might not be allowed in.{02}{00}
Conservato? That fool. He{03}refuses to acknowledge what{03}he can see with his own eyes!{02}{00}
I will meet with the king and{03}press our evidence upon{03}Conservato. Come with me!{02}{00}
Gah! Stupid door!{02}{00}
{09}{02}HAHHH-AHH!{02}{00}
Pah! At last, you are open!{02}{00}
To the king's chambers!{02}{00}
Lunpa ought to be as old as{03}Lord Babi was, but he has so{03}much energy!{02}{00}
He's got a fire in him.{02}{00}
I do wish I could have heard{03}more about Lord Babi, though.{02}{00}
But come, {11}{05}!{03}To the king's palace we go!{02}{00}
King Hydros awaits you.{03}You are free to enter.{02}{00}
His Highness, the king, has{03}instructed that we let you{03}pass. You are welcome here.{02}{00}
They are clearly using Psynergy,{03}which makes them Adepts...{01}But are they so important that{03}His Highness must make time{03}for them right away?{02}{00}
What does His Highness have{03}in mind? {11}{08}, his{03}friends, and Lunpa are all here.{02}{00}
He is still in chambers with{03}Lord Conservato. Why is he{03}granting them entrance?{02}{00}
If you seek the counsel of His{03}Highness, the king, follow this{03}passage to the doors at the end.{02}{00}
His Highness never leaves a{03}meeting with Conservato in a{03}good mood. Good luck.{02}{00}
Conservato and the king were{03}yelling so loudly that I could{03}hear them from out here.{02}{00}
King Hydros is the wisest of{03}all the Lemurian kings...{01}But I understand why{03}Conservato and his senate{03}oppose the king's plans.{02}{00}
The senate holds King Hydros in{03}poor regard because he favors{03}Lunpa's wisdom over their own.{02}{00}
Lord Conservato holds the{03}most power in Lemuria after{03}the king.{01}I don't think he'll take{03}kindly to the advice of{03}outworlders like these.{02}{00}
Oh, dear! Using Psynergy in the{03}palace of the good King Hydros!?{03}What ill-mannered buffoons!{02}{00}
His Highness, the king, is most{03}temperamental, which is a rare{03}trait in Lemurians.{01}Lord Conservato is calm and{03}collected, like a true Lemurian.{02}{00}
Lord Conservato only raises his{03}voice when he speaks with the{03}king.{01}Their debates frighten me.{03}I can't stand the yelling.{02}{00}
His Highness is worried that{03}Lemuria will wither away.{03}What a ridiculous notion!{02}{00}
I trust the king. If His Majesty{03}is wrong, the fault lies with{03}Lunpa, not with him.{02}{00}
I cannot let the secret of our{03}mystical draught ever reach{03}the outside world.{02}{00}
If the world knew our mystic{03}draughts were nothing but{03}spring water, we'd be overrun!{02}{00}
You are Lord {11}{05}, correct?{1E}{00}
Then you have no business here!{03}His Majesty is involved in a most{03}important meeting right now.{02}{00}
It would seem the warriors of{03}which you spoke have arrived.{02}{00}
So it would, Your Highness.{03}I shall call them to us{03}immediately.{02}{00}
There is no need, Lunpa.{03}Let us go to them.{02}{00}
Hydros! Would you see me{03}dishonored thus? They ought{03}to present themselves to us!{02}{00}
I do not go to present myself{03}to them, Conservato. I am{03}merely going to where they are.{01}I have something that I{03}wish to show everyone.{02}{00}
Regardless of your reasons,{03}sire, I will not go to them!{02}{00}
Do as you will, Conservato.{02}{00}
However, {09}{02}we{07} shall go.{02}{00}
I heard of your arrival. It is{03}quite remarkable that you were{03}able to reach Lemuria. Welcome.{02}{00}
Allow me to introduce my{03}companions. This is {11}{07}...{02}{00}
{11}{06}...{02}{00}
{11}{05}...{02}{00}
...And Kraden.{02}{00}
Kraden is the one who told{03}me of the outside world's{03}civilizations, of their condition...{02}{00}
Ah, Kraden! Lunpa describes{03}you as a remarkable scholar.{03}Your research impressed us.{02}{00}
Thank you, Your Highness.{02}{00}
Your theories are correct.{03}Our world is now on a path{03}to destruction.{02}{00}
And who has decided this?{03}You, Hydros?{02}{00}
Some civilizations have{03}vanished, surely, but that is{03}the way of the outside world.{01}Look around you: Lemuria{03}remains unchanged!{02}{00}
Don't delude yourself. Lemuria{03}has been in slow decline for{03}ages now, but that can wait.{02}{00}
My most trusted scholars have{03}reached this conclusion after{03}extensive research.{02}{00}
I sent {11}{08} to confirm{03}this for me...{02}{00}
So you admit it, Hydros!{03}You violated the directive{03}of the senate!{01}You used the tidal wave as{03}your chance to send {11}{08}{03}away, despite our commands!{02}{00}
You are incorrect. The tidal{03}wave carried me away{03}by chance alone.{02}{00}
Conservato, you must know{03}that the tidal wave was caused{03}by Poseidon's return!{02}{00}
Only a fool would have chosen{03}to send a man to sea if he knew{03}that this would have happened.{02}{00}
What was it that you intended{03}to have {11}{08} confirm?{02}{00}
This map shows the ancient world,{03}when Lemuria still traded with{03}people on the many continents.{02}{00}
It was a great age...{03}A time when the world{03}shined brightly.{02}{00}
And this...is the map Lunpa had{03}with him when he arrived in{03}Lemuria 150 years ago...{02}{00}
I used this map to sail around{03}the world. It is quite accurate.{02}{00}
In-Incredible!{02}{00}
You understand, Kraden...{02}{00}
What do you understand?{02}{00}
Well, unless my eyes deceive{03}me, the continents have shrunk{03}since the golden age...{02}{00}
That's insane!{02}{00}
It is not insane! It is true!{02}{00}
Perhaps this will make the{03}point more clearly. Look at{03}these two maps side by side.{02}{00}
There's no mistaking it.{03}The continents on Lunpa's{03}map are clearly smaller...{02}{00}
Lies! Nothing but lies!{02}{00}
What do you hope to gain{03}from foisting these lies{03}upon our people?{02}{00}
You know well that I hope{03}to gain nothing more than{03}the truth, Conservato.{02}{00}
And who do you expect will{03}believe such nonsense?{02}{00}
If you do not believe the{03}evidence before your eyes,{03}what do you believe?{02}{00}
Do you believe the Lemurian{03}map to be accurate to this day?{02}{00}
Tell me, {11}{08}... You were{03}able to investigate this{03}matter, were you not?{02}{00}
Thanks to {11}{05} and my{03}companions, I was able to travel{03}much of the Eastern Sea.{02}{00}
And what did you find?{02}{00}
I found, in truth, that Lunpa's map{03}is the more accurate of the two.{02}{00}
However, the world seems even{03}smaller now than it appears on{03}Lunpa's map...{02}{00}
What are you saying?{02}{00}
Time itself has stopped...{02}{00}
Think of Weyard as a living,{03}breathing being, possessing{03}its own life force...{02}{00}
The four elements are the{03}nourishment needed to sustain{03}this being.{02}{00}
Kraden... This is exactly what{03}King Hydros himself has said{03}to me!{02}{00}
Ever since Alchemy was sealed{03}away, the world has been cut off{03}from its nourishment.{01}It has gone into a state{03}akin to hibernation.{02}{00}
By using less energy, Weyard{03}prolongs its life...{02}{00}
Yet when hibernating, the being{03}has only stopped its own clock...{03}not the flow of time around it.{02}{00}
When a bear sleeps through{03}the winter, it needs only wait{03}for spring to come...{01}When it awakens, it can nourish{03}its weakened body again...{02}{00}
But if spring never comes,{03}the bear will eventually die...{02}{00}
Weyard is wasting away, its{03}continents shrinking, because{03}its spring has never come.{02}{00}
Hydros, how can you make such{03}outrageous claims? The world{03}is not alive...{02}{00}
Tell me, Conservato, why do you{03}think Poseidon has returned?{02}{00}
Do you have the answer, Hydros?{02}{00}
The elemental lighthouses...{02}{00}
{11}{05} and his companions{03}have lit the beacons on both{03}Mercury and Venus Lighthouse.{02}{00}
What!? Have you any idea what{03}will happen if you set that evil{03}loose upon the world again?{1E}{00}
You know that it could bring{03}about the destruction of the{03}world, and yet you did it anyway?{02}{00}
When the four beacons are fired,{03}Alchemy will be released, and{03}our world, destroyed.{02}{00}
My lord, you cannot possibly{03}intend for these people to light{03}the remaining beacons!?{02}{00}
I do indeed, Conservato, and I{03}also fear the possibility that{03}Alchemy will destroy the world.{02}{00}
But I cannot stand by, knowing{03}as I do that the world will wither{03}and die if we do not act!{02}{00}
This is madness, Hydros! Does{03}the threat of Alchemy mean{03}so little to you?{01}Would you put the world{03}in even greater danger to{03}satisfy your theories!?{02}{00}
With only two of the beacons{03}lit, I assume you intend to send{03}{11}{08} out again?{02}{00}
And I will go, Lord Conservato.{03}{11}{05} has need of{03}my power!{02}{00}
Then go, {11}{08}...{03}But if you do, say farewell...for{03}you will never be able to return.{01}You will be banished from{03}Lemuria forever.{02}{00}
You know our laws. Are you{03}prepared for the outcome?{02}{00}
I myself am disgusted by{03}the whole matter. I take{03}my leave of you, Hydros.{02}{00}
But I warn you... I will {09}{02}not{07}{03}permit you to go through{03}with this madness!{02}{00}
What will you do, Your Highness?{02}{00}
I knew this outcome was{03}inevitable.{02}{00}
But I could not sit silent while{03}our world drifted down the{03}path of its destruction.{02}{00}
I want you to light the{03}remaining beacons before{03}you return.{02}{00}
That's what we intend to do,{03}but we cannot leave the{03}Eastern Sea...{02}{00}
I have already heard of{03}this problem from {11}{08}...{02}{00}
This is something I found{03}by accident in some ruins{03}back in my days as a thief.{02}{00}
I'm not sure what it is,{03}but it seems to contain{03}some powerful Psynergy.{02}{00}
Seems to? You are{03}not certain?{02}{00}
It is a Psynergy that we{03}Lemurians are unable to use.{02}{00}
I understand you travel with{03}many different kinds of Adepts,{03}do you not, {11}{05}?{02}{00}
If we include {11}{08} in our{03}numbers, we have one Adept{03}for each of the four elements.{02}{00}
Then at least one of you should{03}be able to use the Psynergy{03}that this contains.{02}{00}
King Hydros believes the item{03}can only be used by one who{03}wields Psynergy of the earth.{02}{00}
If I am not mistaken, it{03}is a powerful Psynergy{03}we call Grind.{02}{00}
If you master this Psynergy,{03}the reefs that block your way{03}shall pose no trouble anymore...{02}{00}
With Grind, you should be able{03}to create a path by which you{03}can sail into the Western Sea.{02}{00}
Go, brave Adepts! By your hands,{03}may the remaining lighthouses{03}burn bright once more!{02}{00}
That Psynergy is quite{03}powerful. It can only be{03}trusted to a very few people.{02}{00}
That His Highness has given{03}it to you should illustrate how{03}great his expectations are.{02}{00}
I have no doubt that your journey{03}will be fraught with ever-{03}increasing danger...{01}But we are counting on{03}you, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
I've never seen Lord Conservato{03}so angry before...{02}{00}
Lord Conservato has ordered{03}us to prevent you from leaving{03}the island...{01}But I cannot see why he would{03}do something like that.{02}{00}
I'm sure the senate has{03}something to say about this.{03}What's going on around here?{02}{00}
How could Lord Conservato{03}expect someone like me to{03}believe that King Hydros...{01}Would order {11}{08} to{03}destroy the world?{02}{00}
Lord Conservato seemed very{03}angry. Maybe that's why he{03}called for a senate meeting.{02}{00}
Both Lord Conservato and the{03}king want peace for us, so why{03}must they fight all the time?{02}{00}
Maybe once you have left,{03}the king and Conservato{03}will come to an accord.{02}{00}
Today, His Highness and Lord{03}Conservato were arguing more{03}loudly than ever before!{02}{00}
If Hydros plans to unleash{03}Alchemy upon the world{03}again, then I am against it.{02}{00}
If you and Lunpa were all to{03}leave Lemuria, I think we'd have{03}peace and quiet here again.{02}{00}
The senate's reports usually{03}tend to influence the popular{03}opinion in Lemuria.{01}I'll bet that is a constant{03}annoyance to the king...{02}{00}
The king's leadership is too{03}progressive... It's as though he{03}invites opposition.{01}Of course he doesn't get along{03}with the senate. It's their duty{03}to protect the laws of old!{02}{00}
Whenever outsiders arrive{03}in Lemuria, it means trouble.{01}{11}{08} has done{03}nothing but stir up trouble{03}by bringing them here.{02}{00}
What will happen to us? Will{03}Lord Conservato be able to{03}stop the king's plans?{02}{00}
As long as I can live in peace,{03}I am happy. I suppose that is a{03}sign of growing old...{02}{00}
I know why Lemuria ended{03}all its dealings with the{03}outside world...{01}Lemurians want peace.{03}We desire no change.{02}{00}
Do not listen to Conservato.{03}We cannot let the world{03}wither and die.{01}Go, brave Adepts! By your hands,{03}may the remaining lighthouses{03}burn bright once more!{02}{00}
You must sail to the Western Sea.{03}Do not worry about Lemuria.{03}Ignite the elemental beacons.{01}Conservato lacks the conviction{03}to discuss these matters with{03}the people of Lemuria.{02}{00}
I think I overheard something{03}I shouldn't have... I'll forget{03}everything.{02}{00}
My people may not desire{03}change, but I cannot let that{03}stop me.{01}I do this not for myself, but{03}for all those yet to be born{03}throughout Weyard.{02}{00}
His Majesty has come to this{03}decision on his own, without{03}the counsel of his advisors.{01}This is why I must remain{03}by his side and support his{03}decision.{02}{00}
The actions of King Hydros{03}are treasonous. They betray{03}the will of his people.{02}{00}
The door is locked... It sounds{03}as if there's a raucous caucus{03}going on inside...{02}{00}
Umm... {11}{08}?{1E}{00}
Yes, {11}{07}? What is it?{1E}{00}
There's something I've{05}{03}been meaning to ask you...{03}Something I{05} have to ask you...{1E}{00}
Ask me, {11}{07}.{1E}{00}
You and I look roughly{03}the same age, but {05}how{03}old are you, really?{1E}{00}
Is that your question,{03}{11}{07}? It's not important!{1E}{00}
It is to me. If you are much older{03}than us, then I'm afraid we've not{03}shown you the proper respect.{1E}{00}
She's got a point.{1E}{00}
Don't worry about such things.{03}Please, treat me as you have{03}all along.{1E}{00}
No, that won't do.{03}You have to tell us.{1E}{00}
What!? Come now!{03}This is silly!{1E}{00}
No, {11}{08}! Tell me!{1E}{00}
You're afraid you haven't shown{03}me the proper respect, and yet{03}you make demands of me?{1E}{00}
Come on, {11}{08}...{03}You can tell us.{03}How old are you really?{1E}{00}
This has nothing to do with{03}respect! You just want to know{03}how old I am, don't you!{1E}{00}
Hee hee!{1E}{00}
Heh heh!{1E}{00}
Oh ho ho ho!!!{1E}{00}
I knew it! Come on,{03}{11}{05}! Can't you get{03}them off my back?{1E}{00}
... ...{1E}{00}
You're in this too, aren't you,{03}{11}{05}? I've had it with your{03}conspiracies! I will not tell you!{1E}{00}
Oh!{02}{00}
Goodness!{02}{00}
{11}{05}! Look over here!{03}This palace is magnificient!{02}{00}
Where are you going, {11}{05}?{03}Let's take a longer look around!{02}{00}
{11}{05}, are we setting{03}off now?{1E}{00}
Then, to sea we go!{02}{00}
Please don't rush on my{03}account. Let's enjoy our stay.{02}{00}
What's the matter?{03}Can't you climb up?{03}...Fine. Just a moment.{02}{00}
You came all this way and{03}then got stuck here? You{03}can't be very bright.{02}{00}
There! Is that better?{03}Now climb up here.{02}{00}
Drinking from this spring{03}restores vigor and vitality!{03}Want a sip?{02}{00}
These turtles have lived in{03}the spring forever... It must be{03}the water that does it...{02}{00}
{11}{05} and the others{03}drank of the spring.{01}Their HP and PP were{03}fully replenished!{02}{00}
{11}{05} read the sign:{01}The Spring of Lemuria{03}Face away and toss in a{03}coin to test your luck.{02}{00}
{11}{05} read the sign:{01}The Spring of Lemuria{03}Toss in a Lucky Medal{03}to improve your luck.{02}{00}
If you face away from the spring,{03}toss in a coin, and land it in the{03}target, good fortune will come.{01}You've traveled a long way{03}to be here. You should give{03}it a try.{02}{00}
I'd love to test my luck, but{03}I've used up all my coins. Maybe{03}I'll take one out of the spring!{02}{00}
I remember an outsider who came{03}to Lemuria and then spent {09}{02}days{07}{03}testing his luck at the spring!{02}{00}
He had such a good time, he{03}said he was going to build a{03}spring like this in his hometown.{02}{00}
Do you wish to test your luck{03}at the Spring of Lemuria?{1E}{00}
Well, then, I'll just take{03}a turn...{01}If you change your mind,{03}let me know, and I will give{03}you a chance.{02}{00}
Go ahead.{03}Test your luck!{02}{00}
You look like you're in for{03}a spell of good luck.{01}After all, your aura glows{03}brightly about you!{02}{00}
No one is luckier than him{03}who believes in his luck and{03}has friends who believe in him.{02}{00}
Don't tell me, you're here to{03}solve the riddle of the rock!{1E}{00}
I don't want to scare you but,{03}I think you should reconsider.{01}Even the warriors who survive{03}to make it back do so by the{03}skin of their teeth.{02}{00}
Just passing through? Here's{03}some advice for you:{03}Steer clear of the mountain.{01}I don't know what kind of{03}treasure's up there, but it's{03}not worth your life.{02}{00}
I hear Kibombo has finally{03}chosen a new witch doctor.{01}Maybe now, they'll calm down{03}and not be so aggressive...{02}{00}
There was a giant explosion{03}on the rock the other night...{03}I couldn't get back to sleep at all.{02}{00}
The mountain is called Magma{03}Rock, and it's cursed... No one's{03}supposed to go up there.{02}{00}
We're lucky the river floods{03}over every season. That's what{03}keeps the Kibombo away.{01}We were fine this year, though.{03}They still hadn't chosen a new{03}witch doctor, so they stayed put.{02}{00}
The explosions within Magma{03}Rock are called magma balls.{01}They're formed naturally{03}near the mouth of the{03}volcano. Scary, huh?{02}{00}
You must be very brave to{03}come all the way here by boat.{02}{00}
There's a place called Shaman{03}Village in the middle of{03}the continent.{01}Supposedly, one of the rivers{03}leads to it. I have no idea{03}which one, though.{02}{00}
The people of Shaman Village{03}are very wary of strangers. Be{03}careful if you ever meet them.{02}{00}
For a continent as desolate{03}as this one, there sure have{03}been a lot of boats here lately.{02}{00}
I think there's a cave down{03}at the end of the river. That's{03}the way into Shaman Village.{01}I wonder if I should tell them{03}what the legends say... Nah,{03}they look like a smart group.{02}{00}
Long ago, Shaman was{03}ravaged by outsiders.{03}It was terrible.{01}From that day on, they simply{03}have not trusted strangers{03}in their village.{02}{00}
If you want to cross the glaciers{03}of the Northern Sea, you'll need{03}magma balls...{01}They come from volcanoes, but{03}the best place to get them is{03}Magma Rock, to the south.{02}{00}
A long time ago, we used to{03}trade with a village named Prox{03}to the north of us.{01}But the sea freezes in winter,{03}and over time, it just became{03}impossible to get there.{02}{00}
The people of Loho have a{03}legendary weapon called a{03}cannon that fires magma balls.{01}That's supposed to be how{03}they crossed the frozen wastes,{03}but it sounds like a tall tale.{02}{00}
The Northern Sea is thick with{03}icebergs in the winter. They{03}can sink a boat in an instant!{02}{00}
There's nothing to the west of{03}here. AND it's really dangerous.{03}You shouldn't go that way.{02}{00}
The sea west of here spills{03}over a massive waterfall.{01}You'll really start to appreciate{03}the grandeur of nature if you{03}see that, I can tell you.{02}{00}
The currents are so strong{03}near the falls that any boat{03}caught in it is doomed.{02}{00}
My buddy thinks I'm nuts{03}to risk my life for a look{03}at the falls.{01}Actually, I just want to get{03}my hands on some treasure{03}I saw on the way there.{02}{00}
We've made these wings and{03}carried them here just to{03}fulfill a great prophecy.{02}{00}
We must be prepared to{03}attach these wings to{03}the sacred vessel.{01}It is said that we will know{03}the time has come when{03}Mt. Jupiter is in flames.{02}{00}
We brought these wings from{03}Contigo, and now we're guarding{03}them.{01}If they were damaged or{03}broken, the prophecy might{03}never be fulfilled.{02}{00}
I wonder if these giant wings{03}will really make it fly... I'd{03}like to see that.{02}{00}
We first heard the prophecy{03}three years ago... The wings{03}have come a long way since then.{02}{00}
These wings are so heavy{03}that they would sink an{03}ordinary ship.{01}I wonder what kind of ship{03}the sacred vessel is.{02}{00}
I doubt anyone could hurt{03}these sturdy wings, but we{03}must guard them just the same.{02}{00}
It's kind of hard to imagine{03}what these wings would look{03}like actually flapping.{02}{00}
There's something burning{03}like an ember within the stone.{02}{00}
Do you want to retrieve it?{1E}{00}
{11}{05} got{03}a Magma Ball.{02}{00}
{11}{05} checked the tablet...{03}There's something etched on it.{01}Wielder of Flame's strength,{03}Lay your hands upon this stone.{01}If th'art worthy, I will grant thee{03}the power to Blaze with fire.{02}{00}
Flame's strength? Hey, that must{03}mean it's finally my turn!{02}{00}
{11}{06} touched the tablet.{02}{00}
{11}{06} received the{03}fire Psynergy Blaze.{02}{00}
Do you know anything about a{03}legend about these people who{03}could control the wind and air?{1E}{00}
Well, the legend says that these{03}giants from Anemos built{03}Contigo with their wind powers.{02}{00}
That was the Anemos tribe.{03}They even had the power to{03}fly through the air!{01}The people of Contigo inherited{03}some of their power, and now,{03}we rule over Atteka.{02}{00}
The beacon within Jupiter{03}Lighthouse will soon be lit.{01}I know this because of a{03}strange premonition I had{03}three years ago.{02}{00}
I guess the people of Contigo{03}lost the power they inherited{03}from the Anemos tribe.{02}{00}
The people of Anemos possessed{03}power over the wind. They could{03}also see into the future.{02}{00}
When the power of Anemos is{03}lost, a group will come to light{03}the beacon against darkness.{01}We had thought it was{03}nothing but legend, but{03}it is all coming true.{02}{00}
The Anemos geoglyphs show a{03}boat with wings sprouting from{03}its hull...{01}The story goes that these{03}wings could make the boat{03}float in the air...{02}{00}
If you want to get a look at{03}the Anemos geoglyphs, you{03}ought to go to the ruins...{02}{00}
Our people have labored{03}for some time to build{03}the Wings of the Anemos.{02}{00}
The Anemos blood in our{03}veins often brings about{03}strange miracles.{02}{00}
Surely, someone will come{03}soon to light the beacon{03}atop the lighthouse.{02}{00}
The power of the wind is{03}not all that we've lost.{01}We have lost much of{03}our culture, as well as the{03}technology to rebuild the ruins.{02}{00}
There were two siblings born in{03}Contigo. The older held great{03}power. Both are gone now...{01}The younger was only a baby{03}when he left the village. I don't{03}know how strong he became.{02}{00}
I think Jupiter Lighthouse will{03}be lit soon. I don't know when,{03}but it will happen soon.{02}{00}
It's hard to believe, but the{03}Anemos really did have the{03}power to make ships fly.{02}{00}
The Anemos geoglyphs are{03}the most amazing carvings{03}I've ever seen...{02}{00}
We built the Wings of Anemos{03}out of materials we found in{03}the ruins of Anemos Sanctum.{02}{00}
The siblings who inherited the{03}powers of the Anemos aren't{03}in Contigo anymore.{01}The younger brother was just{03}a baby when the merchant{03}known as Hammet took him away.{02}{00}
I'm sure the younger brother,{03}{11}{03}, must be grown up{03}by now... Is he still with Hammet?{02}{00}
My father doesn't approve of{03}the way I look up to Yegelos.{02}{00}
The families of children who{03}inherited those powers lived{03}lives of constant suffering.{01}Eventually, they left Contigo to{03}make their fortunes elsewhere.{02}{00}
{11}{03}'s mother left him in{03}the care of a kindly merchant.{03}She died shortly afterward.{01}I think she died of sorrow at{03}sending {11}{03} away. She{03}wanted a better life for him.{02}{00}
I wish I could have inherited{03}the power of the Anemos.{03}Then I could be a hero.{02}{00}
Long ago, the people of{03}Hesperia attacked Atteka. Our{03}forefathers were not afraid.{01}With the help of the great hero{03}Yegelos, we drove them off, and{03}they haven't invaded since.{02}{00}
A long time ago, the tribes{03}of Shaman and Contigo were{03}at constant war.{01}Throughout their many battles,{03}the warriors Yegelos and{03}Hoabna formed a friendship.{02}{00}
For a long time now, Contigo{03}has been without a hero. This{03}depresses our youth, I think.{02}{00}
Everybody thinks the people{03}of Contigo are strong, but{03}we just hate to fight.{01}It's strange, because Yegelos{03}loved to fight, and Hoabna{03}was the stronger of the two.{02}{00}
Soon, the siblings with the{03}power of the Anemos will{03}return and fulfill the legend.{02}{00}
The power of the Anemos is{03}all but gone in Contigo.{01}However, it sometimes happens{03}that a newborn suddenly{03}shows power over the wind.{02}{00}
I don't have any powers like{03}the Anemos did, but my sister,{03}Ahri, is different.{02}{00}
The baby's forehead is{03}furrowed, like it's thinking.{02}{00}
Babu bawaba bibaw.{02}{00}
It sure is drafty in this{03}shabby old house.{02}{00}
When the Wings of Anemos are{03}complete, let's fix the house!{02}{00}
I just know {11}{03} became{03}big and manly, just like{03}Yegelos. I know he'll return...{02}{00}
A terrible misfortune fell on{03}the family of the siblings...{03}It's a terrible story.{02}{00}
Whenever my sister furrows{03}her brow like that, strange{03}things happen around here.{02}{00}
Bawaba... It's hot...{03}I want cool wind, babu baba.{02}{00}
It was a longstanding tradition{03}that people in Atteka would take{03}a pilgrimage to Anemos Sanctum.{01}Since we began construction{03}on the wings, everyone is{03}coming to Contigo to help.{02}{00}
Of course, they're here to work,{03}not to fight, so business is{03}still in the pits.{02}{00}
Mining materials in the ruins{03}is dangerous work, so my{03}armor is selling well.{02}{00}
Nothing else around here is{03}selling well, but at least I'm{03}pulling through all right.{02}{00}
The villagers are working their{03}hardest to complete the wings{03}and fulfill the prophecy.{02}{00}
Oh, how I want to see the{03}sunlight shining off these{03}wings up in the sky!{02}{00}
We've had so many people{03}coming to Contigo lately{03}that we're full, and I'm beat!{02}{00}
All the work on the wings{03}means that our inn is always{03}full! It's a good time for us!{02}{00}
Gotta make all the beds{03}before everyone returns{03}from Anemos Sanctum...{01}Then, I've gotta get started{03}setting things up for dinner{03}before they come down to eat!{02}{00}
If I don't make dinner now,{03}it won't be ready in time for{03}all our guests to eat!{02}{00}
Did you just arrive in Contigo?{01}Are you connected to the{03}prophecy, or are you here to{03}help build the wings?{02}{00}
The prophecies of the Anemos{03}tell that someday soon, a true{03}miracle will occur...{02}{00}
I worked myself half to death{03}yesterday. I feel miserable, but{03}I'll do it again tomorrow.{02}{00}
The Wings of Anemos are{03}nearly complete... I think I'll{03}take tomorrow off.{02}{00}
I'm afraid I'm too old to help in{03}the construction of the wings,{03}but I so want to see them fly...{02}{00}
When is that miracle of the{03}Anemos gonna hurry up and{03}happen? I can't wait forever!{02}{00}
I threw my back out helping with{03}the wings. I can't touch my toes.{03}I can barely touch my knees.{02}{00}
I want to see the boat{03}when it sails through the{03}air on our wings.{01}But even more, I want to see{03}the hero of prophecy... Will he{03}be a real looker, like Yegelos?{02}{00}
The real miracle will be if{03}these wings actually make{03}a boat fly.{01}However, I remain open-minded.{03}I hope we can see this miracle{03}of Anemos soon!{02}{00}
If I see the Wings of Anemos{03}make a boat fly through the{03}air, I too shall be a believer.{02}{00}
I've come a long way to{03}see the flying boat. I hope{03}the prophecies are right.{02}{00}
The wings are almost done.{03}We just need to get them to{03}the bay and await the ship.{02}{00}
The wings will be finished{03}shortly. Where is the ship{03}they're going to be attached to?{02}{00}
Which part goes where? Does{03}this metal feather connect{03}to that wooden post?{01}It's like a puzzle, and it's{03}getting rather complicated.{02}{00}
You've gotta watch out, 'cause{03}you don't want to break{03}anything... It's delicate work!{02}{00}
Just a few more touches, and{03}the wings are done. All we have{03}left is to assemble them!{02}{00}
The guys carrying the other wing{03}haven't come back, and we're{03}almost ready to send this one!{02}{00}
I've been really busy lately,{03}but now that the second wing{03}is almost done, I can rest.{02}{00}
What do we do if we made{03}these wings, and then no boat{03}shows up for us to put them on?{02}{00}
There are too many parts!{03}I think I'm going insane from{03}all these stupid parts!{02}{00}
When I start getting irritated,{03}I just go nuts. I think I should{03}avoid getting irritated.{02}{00}
How long have we been{03}working on these stupid{03}wings?{01}When I see that boat{03}soaring through the{03}skies, I think I'll cry.{02}{00}
Have you taken a good look{03}at the Anemos geoglyph?{1E}{00}
You can't see all of it right{03}now, because the wings are{03}covering up the picture...{02}{00}
Oh, that's really too bad.{03}The picture of the flying{03}boat looks so cool.{02}{00}
That sign has a translation of{03}the characters on the wall.{01}If you're interested in studying{03}the sanctum, you should give it{03}a read.{02}{00}
I want to get a good look at{03}the inside of the sanctum, but{03}I can't get this door open.{01}I'm hoping that deciphering{03}these characters on the wall{03}might give me the clue I need.{02}{00}
The merchant Hammet took{03}the gold in this room with{03}him when he left Contigo.{01}He vowed to use the money{03}to raise {11}{03} properly{03}and give him a good life.{02}{00}
I can't even imagine how cool{03}it would be to see a boat like{03}the one in the geoglyph.{01}But it's so big! I doubt{03}there's a boat that big{03}anywhere!{02}{00}
I don't know if anyone{03}in Contigo cares about{03}what I'm doing here.{01}But I know that devoted{03}pilgrims will appreciate{03}having this translation.{02}{00}
Wouldn't that be terrible if{03}I got the door open and there{03}was nothing on the other side?{02}{00}
Someone told me that Hammet{03}went to a town called Kalay{03}and did quite well for himself.{02}{00}
{11}{05} examined the wall.{03}There are characters carved{03}into it.{01}Hmmm... I keep staring at it,{03}but it's not making any{03}more sense.{02}{00}
{11}{05} examined the sign.{03}The characters from the wall{03}are translated there.{01}Some them are gates, and{03}some them are roads.{01}Search with your heart to{03}find the truest path.{02} {00}
Turn the slot and get a prize!{03}The lottery slots are over here.{02}{00}
Drop some cash and double up!{03}The hi-lo dice are over here!{02}{00}
You never know what the{03}dice will do next! Come and{03}give our dice a toss!{02}{00}
It's good to have this much{03}business, but what happens to{03}us when the wings are done?{02}{00}
Once the wings are finished,{03}all these guests will leave.{03}Until then, I'll work my hardest.{02}{00}
I've got so much to do that{03}I don't even have time to{03}eat! I'm starving!!!{02}{00}
I must be the greatest chef in{03}the world! Look at all this food{03}I've been making! I'm amazing!{02}{00}
... ...{02}{00}
Hm. Outsiders... I don't like{03}the looks of them. I'm just{03}going to wait until they leave.{02}{00}
Until the chief says otherwise,{03}nobody will talk to these{03}outsiders. It's the law.{02}{00}
Who invited these foreigners{03}into our town?{02}{00}
Ugh... Foreigners. I'm not{03}going to waste my time{03}even {09}{02}talking{07} to them!{02}{00}
Our ancestors learned a harsh{03}lesson... Shamans never lie, but{03}outsiders are never honest.{02}{00}
Our ancestors learned that we{03}can trust no one but the people{03}of Contigo, our longtime friends.{02}{00}
These foreigners look{03}trustworthy, but I know{03}better...{01}They may seem nice, but all{03}outsiders are wicked!{02}{00}
Shut your doors tight{03}when outsiders are in sight.{01}If we want to protect ourselves,{03}our culture, we have to keep{03}outsiders {09}{02}out{07}.{02}{00}
It seems to be locked.{02}{00}
Trial Road{03}None may enter without{03}permission from Moapa.{02}{00}
The entrance is closed.{03}You probably shouldn't go in.{02}{00}
This is my house. If you're{03}looking for Moapa, here I am.{03}Back up. Give me some room.{02}{00}
Who have we here? Strangers{03}in Shaman Village? What is your{03}purpose in coming here?{02}{00}
Shaman Village does not{03}appreciate intruders.{02}{00}
You're not welcome here,{03}outlander. Leave now, and{03}never come back.{02}{00}
If there's something you want{03}to say, hurry up and say it.{03}I'll listen, but not for long!{02}{00}
What's wrong? Nothing to say?{03}Then what are you standing{03}around for? Get out of town!{02}{00}
If there's something you want{03}to say, say it to Moapa, not{03}to us. We don't want to hear it.{02}{00}
If you anger Moapa, you'll be{03}in for a little taste of his{03}awesome and terrible power.{02}{00}
They don't look like they've{03}come from Contigo... There's{03}no reason for us to be nice.{02}{00}
If it hadn't been for Moapa,{03}I'd have been glad to fling{03}these outlanders into the cold.{02}{00}
Maybe they're looking for{03}treasure. They ought to be{03}looking in Contigo, not here.{01}The temple near Contigo is{03}filled with treasures beyond{03}belief.{02}{00}
If you're here offering charity,{03}I won't have it... Or did you{03}want to show me something?{02}{00}
What makes you think I would{03}be interested in this?{01}Show it to Moapa if you{03}must, but I don't need it.{02}{00}
Yes, yes. That's very nice.{03}Did you want to sell it? Because{03}I don't have any money.{02}{00}
That's the Shaman's Rod!{02}{00}
We thought it was lost{03}forever... It once belonged{03}to the great Hoabna.{02}{00}
Hoabna's staff was a gift from{03}his great friend in Contigo,{03}Yegelos.{01}When Yegelos gave it to him,{03}Hoabna accepted a great{03}responsibility...{02}{00}
He vowed to care for the sacred{03}treasure of Contigo, the Hover{03}Jade...{01}When the Shaman's Rod returns{03}to us, we are charged to give{03}the bearer the Hover Jade.{02}{00}
Have you outlanders come{03}to claim the Hover Jade?{02}{00}
I suppose we have, yes.{02}{00}
That's a shame. We'll never{03}give the Hover Jade to you!{02}{00}
But...we brought you the{03}Shaman's Rod... What's stopping{03}you from giving us the jade?{02}{00}
Hoabna handed the Hover{03}Jade down from generation to{03}generation for our care.{02}{00}
We are to return it to the{03}descendants of Yegelos. And{03}you are clearly not from Contigo.{02}{00}
That's preposterous! We{03}returned your rod! We've come{03}so far already!{02}{00}
What difference does it make{03}if we're from Contigo or not!?{02}{00}
Make no mistake about it. We{03}are the intended recipients of{03}the stone of Yegelos.{02}{00}
Is there some way we can get{03}our hands on the Hover Jade?{02}{00}
No. You ask the impossible.{02}{00}
What about...the test? Would{03}that be a bad idea, Moapa?{02}{00}
You know, Trial Road? Only{03}Yegelos could walk that path.{02}{00}
The way of the vanishing sand!{02}{00}
Yes, if you outlanders intend{03}to claim the Hover Jade, you{03}must fetch it and bring it here!{02}{00}
If you people have the{03}courage, follow me! {02}{00}
If you'd told us there was a{03}test to begin with, we'd have{03}been out of your hair by now.{02}{00}
What kind of test is this?{02}{00}
I understand that you're a{03}little concerned, but unless{03}you try it, you'll never know!{02}{00}
Give it your best, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
Moapa left the door open, and{03}strangers got in... Ah, but they're{03}gone already...{02}{00}
The outlanders look like{03}warriors, but they're nothing{03}next to my father.{01}He's the leader of Shaman{03}Village, but he's also just so{03}strong! He never loses!{02}{00}
Those are the first foreigners{03}I've ever seen... They don't look{03}so different from us.{02}{00}
The card reads "Put {16} coins{03}on the counter, and you can stay."{01}Will you pay {16} coins?{1E}{00}
I don't much like strangers,{03}but if they're willing to pay,{03}I'm willing to let them stay.{02}{00}
Moapa ordered us to let them{03}stay. I don't know why, though.{03}It's not like we lock the doors.{02}{00}
There's something written on{03}the card: "If you don't have any{03}money, feel free to leave. Now."{02}{00}
Nothing personal, but nobody in{03}town will talk to you.{01}It may seem weird, but it's{03}a law among the Shaman{03}tribe.{02}{00}
They'll need to find Moapa{03}if they want to talk to one{03}of the locals.{02}{00}
To inherit the stone of Yegelos,{03}you must cause this sand{03}to disappear.{01}If you can manage that feat,{03}then the blood of Contigo{03}runs through your veins.{02}{00}
Just ahead lies Trial Road,{03}where Hoabna and Yegelos{03}fought their greatest battles.{01}Only superior ones such as{03}they could have followed{03}the road to its end.{02}{00}
When Yegelos and Hoabna{03}waged their mighty battles here,{03}the sand suddenly vanished.{02}{00}
I know the truth. These{03}outlanders stole the rod{03}from Contigo.{01}No matter. Their misdeeds{03}will be revealed to all when{03}they fail the Trial Road.{02}{00}
If they lack the power of Contigo{03}or the power of Shaman Village,{03}they will fail.{02}{00}
They stand no chance of{03}making the sand vanish. They{03}will give up and go home.{02}{00}
You can do it, {11}{07}!{02}{00}
Leave it to me, {11}{06}.{03}This will be a breeze.{02}{00}
I don't believe it. They did{03}it! The sand vanished!{02}{00}
The legends... They were{03}all true!{02}{00}
She's the one! She must{03}have come from Contigo!{02}{00}
Her?{02}{00}
She's the one that did it?{03}But she's...just a girl!{02}{00}
Well, you wanted the sand{03}to vanish, so...{02}{00}
Can we have the Hover{03}Jade now?{02}{00}
Nope, you still can't have it.{02}{00}
What? Why not?{02}{00}
This was just a test to see{03}if you earned the right to{03}take the test to earn the stone.{02}{00}
So, there's more that they{03}have to do before you'll give{03}them the stone?{02}{00}
You will have to reach{03}the end of Trial Road.{02}{00}
The girls, too? Surely you{03}can't make them...{02}{00}
I thought that only the chosen{03}hero could travel the road...{02}{00}
What, are you saying I can't{03}be the chosen hero?{02}{00}
The heroes have always been{03}men, ever since the time of{03}Hoabna. It is the way.{02}{00}
I don't like your attitude,{03}mister! I can be every bit{03}as heroic as some guy!{02}{00}
That may be true, but you{03}must respect our customs.{02}{00}
It's the same in Contigo,{03}you know. If you don't like{03}it, take it up with Yegelos.{02}{00}
Hold it, hold it... Moapa,{03}what were you just saying{03}about Trial Road?{02}{00}
If we reach the end of Trial{03}Road, won't our names join{03}the ranks of your heroes?{02}{00}
Kraden's right... It shouldn't{03}matter if a girl does it... All{03}that matters is that we finish!{02}{00}
If you give us the chance,{03}we will prove it to you.{02}{00}
Unless you're afraid that a{03}girl like me might become{03}your town's newest hero.{02}{00}
Have they earned the right?{03}Shall we let them onto Trial Road?{02}{00}
I don't like the way these{03}outsiders were talking to me.{02}{00}
I think they need to learn{03}exactly what it takes to be{03}a hero around here!{02}{00}
Yeah, if these guys are so{03}stubborn, let's give them a{03}shot! They'll probably give up!{02}{00}
You said it yourselves. We're{03}too stubborn to quit.{02}{00}
Yeah. If you want us "outlanders"{03}to leave, you'd better give us{03}a chance to walk Trial Road!{02}{00}
Trial Road is a difficult one...{03}When you reach the top, a{03}terrible battle awaits you.{02}{00}
It's difficult enough for me. I{03}expect you will find it quite{03}impossible. Still interested?{1E}{00}
You seem confident, but it{03}is your ignorance speaking.{02}{00}
So... You are not as sure of{03}yourselves as you first seemed.{02}{00}
But I will permit this. Follow{03}me, and I shall explain.{02}{00}
Listen carefully to me.{02}{00}
This cave provides you with{03}an opportunity to practice{03}your skills.{02}{00}
Legends say that Yegelos and{03}Hoabna once fought here. These{03}columns commemorate this.{02}{00}
They raced one another{03}to the summit...{02}{00}
And there, they fought with{03}all their might on the peak{03}of the mountain.{02}{00}
In honor of their great{03}battle, the leaders of{03}Shaman created this trial.{02}{00}
The rules are simple.{02}{00}
The room is filled with traps{03}and snares. Use the power of{03}Contigo to avoid them.{02}{00}
This road has four doors. To{03}open them, you will need to{03}place items in these chests. {02}{00}
Why?{02}{00}
The door is triggered only when{03}the treasure chests are filled{03}to the correct weight.{02}{00}
Try putting heavier items, like{03}weapons and tools, into the{03}chests, or the doors won't open.{02}{00}
If you reach the door after{03}your opponents do, you will{03}be at a serious disadvantage.{02}{00}
You see, it will take twice the{03}weight to open the doors.{02}{00}
Stand on the switch, and the{03}number of chests you need{03}to fill will open.{02}{00}
If you are last to each of{03}the four doors, you will lose{03}eight items to the chests!{02}{00}
If Trial Road proves too much{03}for you, press this button.{02}{00}
This ends the battle, though.{03}A true hero would not{03}surrender so easily.{02}{00}
In order to reach the battle{03}at the summit, you cannot{03}fail on Trial Road.{02}{00}
Do you understand?{1E}{00}
Would you like me to{03}explain it to you again?{1E}{00}
Do all outlanders share{03}your thickwittedness?{02}{00}
Then you understand the{03}treacherous path of Trial{03}Road. Will you continue?{1E}{00}
You have chosen wisely,{03}and for your wisdom, you{03}must leave Shaman Village.{02}{00}
You have heard the rules,{03}and you wish to continue.{03}You have been warned.{02}{00}
But what's this? You no{03}longer have the Shaman's Rod?{01}We cannot accept your{03}challenge if you do not have{03}the Shaman's Rod. Leave me.{02}{00}
It looks as though you are{03}missing the item you need{03}if you are to challenge us.{01}Without it, we won't even{03}entertain the idea of competing{03}with you. Leave us at once.{02}{00}
Choose the road of your{03}liking. It matters not to us.{02}{00}
Choose the road of your{03}liking. It matters not to us.{02}{00}
Do you need to hear Moapa's{03}explanation again?{1E}{00}
Thick-witted outsiders.{02}{00}
Then you must leave{03}Shaman Village and forget{03}about the Hover Jade.{02}{00}
Do you need to hear Moapa's{03}explanation again?{1E}{00}
Thick-witted outsiders.{02}{00}
As long as you remain in{03}our village, my people are{03}not free to do as they will.{01}If you are not going to take{03}the challenge of Trial Road,{03}you must leave Shaman Village.{02}{00}
I cannot lose. I will not{03}lose.{01}It is my responsibility as{03}head of the Shaman tribe.{02}{00}
You're doomed. Moapa is{03}the greatest warrior in all{03}of Hesperia.{02}{00}
You don't seem like bad{03}people, for outlanders, but{03}we cannot give you the jade.{01}Only the hero with the blood{03}of Yegelos, the hero of Contigo,{03}can claim the gem.{02}{00}
Have you decided to give up{03}this foolishness once and for all?{1E}{00}
You have chosen wisely,{03}and for your wisdom, you{03}must leave Shaman Village.{02}{00}
Choose the road of your{03}liking. It matters not to us.{02}{00}
If you have chosen, then we{03}shall take the other path.{02}{00}
On the count of three,{03}the challenge begins!{02}{00}
Do you want to challenge{03}me on Trial Road?{1E}{00}
You have chosen wisely,{03}and for your wisdom, you{03}must leave Shaman Village.{02}{00}
Do you need to hear Moapa's{03}explanation again?{1E}{00}
Thick-witted outsiders.{02}{00}
Let's get on with it, then.{02}{00}
Place this item in the chest?{1E}{00}
The chest won't open. There's{03}something keeping it shut tight.{02}{00}
{10} put {12}{01}'s{03}{14}{01} in the chest.{02}{00}
Do you want to give up?{1E}{00}
Yes{00}
No{00}
It would be wise of you to{03}quit. Even if you reach the{03}top, you cannot beat me.{01}You would do well to leave{03}Shaman Village at once.{02}{00}
You may have been slow, but{03}you made it through Trial{03}Road to the mountain's peak!{02}{00}
Well, then... The time is nigh for{03}us to decide who is stronger!{02}{00}
Let the battle begin!{02}{00}
You were quite swift! You{03}may prove a challenge yet!{02}{00}
However, just because you're{03}fast doesn't mean you're strong.{03}Challenge or no, I will win.{02}{00}
Let the battle begin!{02}{00}
You've lost. Now leave{03}Shaman village.{02}{00}
All right, all right. You've{03}proven your strength, and{03}you are heroes indeed.{02}{00}
As we promised, you will{03}receive the Hover Jade, and{03}we will take the Shaman's Rod.{02}{00}
After many years, the vow that{03}Hoabna made to Yegelos has{03}at last been fulfilled!{02}{00}
I'm tired now. I'll be back in{03}the Shaman Village resting.{02}{00}
I'm sure you must be exhausted{03}as well. Let's go back to the{03}village and rest.{02}{00}
So, you rose to the challenge{03}of Trial Road? Moapa was{03}quite impressed with you!{02}{00}
The people of Shaman Village{03}are normally quiet, valiant, and{03}noble.{01}You defeated Moapa, and we{03}must respect the bravery you{03}demonstrated in fighting him.{02}{00}
You defeated Moapa, and{03}that is ample proof of your{03}skill as warriors.{01}I think you will find that the{03}people of Shaman Village{03}treat you quite differently now.{02}{00}
Heroes cannot be evil. And{03}now, we have learned that{03}heroes can be foreigners, too.{02}{00}
Your battle with Moapa was{03}just like the legendary battle{03}between Hoabna and Yegelos!{01}I would love to have watched,{03}to see a new legend in the{03}making...{02}{00}
Everyone in town is talking{03}about how you have fulfilled{03}Hoabna's promise.{02}{00}
After your battle, did you{03}check on the other side{03}of the mountain?{1E}{00}
Did you see the spring? There's{03}supposed to be a spring that{03}only Hoabna could find.{02}{00}
If you have the same powers{03}Hoabna had, you might be able{03}to get there...{01}Nobody with the powers of{03}the Shaman tribe alone can{03}reach the hidden spring.{02}{00}
Some people among the{03}Shaman tribe possess{03}a special power...{01}The story goes that those{03}with this power are the{03}chosen few.{02}{00}
Moapa is quite honorable to{03}sing their praises. This is{03}what makes him a leader.{02}{00}
It's tough to imagine this{03}bunch beating Moapa, but{03}I'm not thinking about it.{02}{00}
Someday, a child in Shaman{03}will grow to be stronger{03}even than Moapa.{01}Then, the Shaman tribe will{03}rise up again and reclaim{03}what it once lost to Contigo.{02}{00}
We are too cautious around{03}strangers. The world should{03}not be such an unfriendly place.{02}{00}
I never thought I'd live{03}to see the day Hoabna's{03}promise was fulfilled.{01}Of course, I never thought{03}anyone with Contigo blood{03}could defeat a Shaman hero.{02}{00}
I hope that we remain{03}close friends with the{03}Contigo after this.{02}{00}
If I had the power to break{03}down walls of sand, I'd climb to{03}the other side of the mountain.{02}{00}
People living on the outskirts{03}of Shaman Village have different{03}powers from us.{01}Why would that be?{02}{00}
I can finally open the door{03}and air the place out.{01}I can't believe Moapa was{03}on the mountain fighting while{03}I was stuck in here.{02}{00}
If I'd known that there was{03}going to be a challenge{03}on Trial Road...{01}I wouldn't have locked up.{03}I'd have been right up there,{03}watching the fight!{02}{00}
I thought it was quiet out here.{03}I've been locked inside all{03}day, so I couldn't check...{01}It was all because they{03}were fighting Moapa up{03}on Trial Road...{02}{00}
Nobody got to watch the{03}challenge at Trial Road. It{03}was just too far from town.{01}What a stupid law, that makes{03}us hide away and miss all{03}the battles!{02}{00}
For years, the people of Hesperia{03}fought against the people of{03}Atteka...{01}Our own Shaman Village was{03}caught up in this war, as{03}were the people of Contigo.{02}{00}
In those dark times, Contigo{03}and Shaman fought repeatedly{03}to protect our lands.{01}We fought to no avail, until{03}we decided to let Hoabna and{03}Yegelos fight for the outcome.{02}{00}
The battles between Shaman{03}and Contigo were terrible, and{03}few warriors ever survived.{01}Eventually, our towns chose{03}Hoabna and Yegelos to fight{03}as our champions.{02}{00}
I've always wondered why the{03}final battle between Hoabna{03}and Yegelos took place here.{01}I think Yegelos was really{03}brave for traveling here all{03}the way from Contigo.{02}{00}
I had thought that, after{03}Yegelos, Contigo remained{03}without a new hero.{01}Now, suddenly, a hero shows{03}up who is mightier even than{03}Moapa. It's beyond belief!{02} {00}
The stories always said that{03}the heroes of Contigo were{03}inferior to our own.{01}Now, I'm not so sure... It{03}sounded like a fair match,{03}and yet Shaman's hero lost.{02}{00}
Grandma and Grandpa have{03}been in a terrible mood since{03}they heard Moapa lost...{01}They're probably tired of being{03}asked about the ancient war{03}between Atteka and Hesperia.{02}{00}
Everyone always comes to ask{03}Grandma and Grandpa about the{03}old battles of legend.{01}It's all anyone ever talks to{03}them about anymore. I'll bet{03}they're tired of it.{02}{00}
Hoolabaloo!{02}{00}
So, you'd like to hear{03}your fortune, would you?{1E}{00}
That's probably good. The{03}things I see are not for{03}everyone to hear.{02}{00}
Well, you caught me in a{03}good mood... I'll do it!{02}{00}
Hoolabaloo!{02}{00}
Ballabahoo!{02}{00}
Hoolabaloola!{02}{00}
I can see it clearly... Your{03}life is thick with danger...{02}{00}
Ooo... Wow, that was a strong{03}one... Listen, don't go south.{03}Bad stuff down there. Wow.{02}{00}
Oh, it's terrible! Awful beyond{03}words! No more, no more!{02}{00}
You should absolutely not go{03}south. Do you hear me? I'm{03}serious about this...{02}{00}
That's weird... Everything is{03}cloudy... The ether is gray{03}and full of mists...{01}The world is undergoing some{03}sort of change, it seems.{02} {00}
So, you'd like to hear{03}your fortune, would you?{1E}{00}
That's probably good. The{03}things I see are not for{03}everyone to hear.{02}{00}
Well, you caught me in a{03}good mood... I'll do it!{02}{00}
Wallamafoo!{02}{00}
Ballabahoo!{02}{00}
Whazupwichoo!{02}{00}
I can see it clearly... Your{03}life is thick with danger...{02}{00}
Ooo... Wow, that was a strong{03}one... North by northeast is...{03}bad. Bad stuff up there. Wow.{02}{00}
Oh, it's terrible! Awful beyond{03}words! No more, no more!{02}{00}
Listen, I want you to promise{03}me you'll NEVER go north by{03}northeast. You got that?{02}{00}
That's weird... Everything is{03}cloudy... The ether is gray{03}and full of mists...{01}The world is undergoing some{03}sort of change, it seems.{02} {00}
Your attacks showed skill{03}and speed, but if we meet{03}in battle again, I won't lose.{02}{00}
I don't think the other villagers{03}will ever forgive us for losing{03}to you on Trial Road.{01}If they had any idea how{03}strong you are, they wouldn't{03}be complaining.{02}{00}
Just climbing to the top of{03}Trial Road is excruciating.{01}It must have been hard for{03}Yegelos and Hoabna, too.{02}{00}
That wasn't a fair fight...{03}I was all worn out from the{03}climb... How could I fight?{01}How did Hoabna manage{03}to fight after climbing a{03}mountain like that!?{02}{00}
You have defeated me, and{03}yet I still don't know your{03}names... Would you tell me?{1E}{00}
A warrior who does not{03}share his name is a{03}humble warrior indeed.{02}{00}
{11}{05}, {11}{06}, {11}{07},{03}and {11}{08}. I shall remember{03}those names.{01}We do not forget the names{03}of heroes who can defeat{03}me in fair combat.{02}{00}
Moapa said that he doesn't{03}even know the names of the{03}heroes who beat him...{01}He feels bad for not having{03}asked. Maybe you should{03}go tell him your names.{02}{00}
In a formal battle, it is both{03}customary and honorable to{03}give your name.{01}It's not too late for you...{03}Please go tell my father{03}your names.{02}{00}
Why does it matter if you{03}know the name of someone{03}who beat you or not?{02}{00}
If a warrior beats you, you{03}must learn his name...{01}Not many people have beaten{03}me, and they deserve my{03}respect.{02}{00}
I would feel bad not knowing{03}the name of a warrior who{03}defeated me, I guess...{02}{00}
What a shame... My own father,{03}losing to some ignorant{03}foreigner with bad manners.{02}{00}
It's so old-fashioned to have{03}to give your name to an{03}opponent before a battle.{02}{00}
I'll never forget the name{03}of anyone I fight.{02}{00}
I was stunned to hear that{03}Moapa lost his battle...{01}His weapons all came from{03}my own warehouse, so I feel{03}a little responsible.{02}{00}
Everyone is depressed that{03}Moapa lost his big fight. They{03}should be glad the hero came!{02}{00}
Although it's not right to{03}blame his loss on the{03}weapons he used.{01}I couldn't afford it if that{03}rumor started going around.{02}{00}
My husband is getting neurotic,{03}worrying about whether his{03}weapons caused the loss.{02}{00}
You've traveled to lots of{03}different lands, haven't you?{1E}{00}
That explains it... The only{03}reason you won is because{03}of your travels...{01}Your strange, exotic{03}weapons are what won{03}the day, not your skill.{02}{00}
I could have sworn that{03}fancy boat was yours...{01}If you can afford such a{03}nice boat, you can probably{03}afford nice weapons, too.{02}{00}
We're very fond of Moapa{03}here. He's a great leader.{01}If anyone in town says{03}something mean to you,{03}please forgive them.{02}{00}
I've been locked up inside{03}all day! I'm so glad to get{03}outside and stretch!{02}{00}
Ah... I've been inside for so{03}long... I think I'll have a little{03}picnic! But what should I eat...{02}{00}
Around here, people like a{03}nice hot steak and some{03}potatoes and beans...{01}You foreigners might be used{03}to strange, exotic food, but{03}we like our meals simple.{02}{00}
Moapa has been miserable{03}since his defeat. If only I could{03}have taken his place up there.{02}{00}
It drives me nuts how{03}worked up everyone gets{03}about Moapa around here.{02}{00}
All of the older people in town{03}are really upset that Moapa{03}lost...{01}It doesn't matter to us kids.{03}I think they're too hung up{03}on tradition.{02} {00}
I'm starving! I can't wait until{03}dinner! I love my meat and{03}potatoes! And BEANS!!!{01}It must be the spices the{03}chef uses... Lots of salt,{03}and lots of pepper!{02}{00}
Those fancy foreign chefs{03}use all sorts of spices to{03}hide the flavor of their food.{01}As far as I'm concerned,{03}there are only two spices:{03}salt and pepper.{02}{00}
You beat Moapa? Incredible!{03}...Not that I ever doubted you!{02}{00}
Don't be too pleased with{03}yourself for beating Moapa.{01}One of these days, we'll{03}come storming into Contigo,{03}and we'll show you what's what!{02}{00}
Oh, please... Let a true{03}warrior be born in Shaman.{03}Let us forget this disgrace!{02}{00}
The older folks of Shaman{03}are quite upset that Moapa{03}was beaten.{01}I'm afraid this might lead{03}to renewed fighting between{03}Shaman and Contigo.{02}{00}
Moapa must have been{03}hungry after climbing the{03}mountain...{01}That's the only way those{03}lousy Contigo nobodies{03}could have beaten him.{02}{00}
I can't forgive the fact{03}that Contigo's heroes beat{03}our leader, Moapa...{01}I hope a new hero is born in{03}Shaman, one who can crush{03}those Contigo barbarians...{02}{00}
{11}{05}, the hero of Contigo!{03}I shall never forget you, the{03}only one that defeated me!{02}{00}
{11}{05}, {11}{06}, {11}{07},{03}and {11}{08}... I won't forget{03}those names...{01}Someday, their names will be{03}engraved on the columns{03}leading to Trial Road.{02}{00}
Ahhhh!!!{00}
{11}{04}!{00}
Noooo!!!{00}
Oof!{00}
{11}{04}!{00}
{11}{02}!{00}
Is that...{05} It's {11}{01}{03}and the others!{02}{00}
{11}{01}? Isn't he a friend{03}of yours, {11}{05}?{1E}{00}
They both come from Vale, and{03}regardless of what {11}{01}{03}believes, they must be allies now!{02}{00}
Don't be that way! You two have{03}much in common, even if you are{03}at odds right now...{02}{00}
But {11}{01} and the others{03}came all this way just to try{03}and stop us!{02}{00}
But didn't you hear that? It{03}sounded like a cry for help...{03}What if they're in trouble?{02}{00}
Hang on, {11}{04}!{03}Don't worry, {11}{02}!{03}Everything will be fine!{02}{00}
Don't worry about me... I'm{03}fine, but {11}{02}...{02}{00}
{11}{02}, you're only using{03}one arm to hang on...{03}What's the matter?{02}{00}
I don't know... I think I hurt my{03}arm when I fell... It's totally{03}numb! I can't move it!{02}{00}
You shouldn't have tried{03}to save me when I fell{03}into that hole...{02}{00}
Oh, {11}{04}, don't blame{03}yourself... I wasn't going to{03}leave you down there!{02}{00}
It's no use! I can't pull{03}you up, {11}{02}! I'm{03}not strong enough!{02}{00}
{11}{01}, please! You've{03}got to save {11}{02}!{02}{00}
This doesn't look good...{03}We have to save {11}{02},{03}and fast!{02}{00}
No, I'm afraid you won't{03}be doing that...{02}{00}
Who are you!?{02}{00}
Me? Why, I'm Karst.{02}{00}
And I'm Agatio.{02}{00}
If you're not here to help my{03}friend, then get out of my{03}way, so I can do it myself!{02}{00}
Your friends will have to take{03}care of themselves. You have{03}a little debt to repay.{02}{00}
Debt? What are you talking{03}about? We've never even{03}seen you before!{02}{00}
Regardless, you have done Karst{03}here a great wrong, and you're{03}beginning to be a hindrance to us.{02}{00}
Wait a second... You two look{03}familiar somehow... Do you{03}know Saturos and Menardi?{02}{00}
So, you're not such a fool{03}after all, {11}{01}! You are{03}right. We are of the same clan.{01}The Fire Clan, from the frozen{03}land of Prox, far to the north!{02}{02}{00}
Prox? Never heard of it.{02}{00}
That doesn't surprise me.{03}Our town hangs on the{03}brink of extinction.{02}{00}
And the seal placed on{03}Alchemy is responsible!{02}{00}
What are you saying? That{03}doesn't make any sense.{02}{00}
It matters not! For soon, Prox{03}will recover its lost power...{02}{00}
We shall bring Prox back from{03}the edge, and then all the people{03}of Weyard will kneel before us!{02}{00}
You think we'd let you, after{03}hearing all that nonsense?{02}{00}
See! You're a hindrance!{02}{00}
And {11}{05} was trying{03}to help you?{02}{00}
Actually...we don't know what{03}{11}{05}'s objectives are.{02}{00}
And we don't care, as long{03}as he lights the beacon on{03}Jupiter Lighthouse.{02}{00}
Then get out of our way!{03}We're here to stop {11}{05}!{02}{00}
Move, or we'll have to{03}move you ourselves!{02}{00}
Did you hear that, Karst?{03}They actually want to fight?{02}{00}
You mean to tell us that{03}you would leave your{03}friend...hanging?{02}{00}
So this was all part{03}of your plan?{02}{00}
Cowards! Stop playing{03}dirty and fight fair!{02}{00}
If you really are the brats who{03}killed Saturos and Menardi, then{03}you've earned some new foes!{02}{00}
But answer me this: would{03}you still cry foul if you were{03}fighting us four on two?{02}{00}
That's why you were waiting{03}up here? To set a trap and{03}make {11}{04} and {11}{02} fall?{02}{00}
We didn't plan on snaring{03}both of them, though... That{03}{09}{02}was{07} a pleasant surprise!{02}{00}
So that's the deal, is it?{03}You came up here to fight us?{02}{00}
Oh, did you figure that out all{03}on your own? Impressive! I'm{03}quite fond of intelligent boys...{02}{00}
I hope you don't think{03}we're afraid of a fair{03}fight, two on two...{02}{00}
A fair fight?{02}{00}
I'm sorry if I misled you, but we{03}have a third... A Water Adept...{03}Alex!{02}{00}
Alex?{05} ...Where is he?{02}{00}
What's wrong, Karst?{02}{00}
It's Alex! He's gone!{02}{00}
What!?{02}{00}
Alex!{00}
Alex?{00}
Did anyone see where{03}he went?{02}{00}
Forget about him! Honestly, I{03}was planning to do the same to{03}him that I'm about to do to them!{02}{00}
My only regret is that I{03}won't be able to wipe that{03}sneering smile off his face.{02}{00}
Well, take out all of your{03}aggressions on these brats...{03}You'll feel better!{02}{00}
{11}{05}! Agatio and Karst{03}are attacking {11}{01}{03}and the others!{02}{00}
Do you think {11}{01} and{03}{11}{03} can handle them{03}without {11}{04} and {11}{02}'s help?{02}{00}
I'm disgusted that Karst{03}would set a trap for them.{03}It's dishonorable!{02}{00}
What if {11}{02} loses his{03}grip while they're still fighting?{02}{00}
There's still time! We have to{03}help {11}{01}!{02}{00}
Ah, {11}{05}... I've been{03}waiting for you.{02}{00}
Have you come here to{03}light the beacon?{1E}{00}
And you're sure that's{03}{09}{02}all{07} you're going to do?{02}{00}
Hmph. They consider you their{03}enemy, and yet you pity them.{02}{00}
I saw you watching when{03}{11}{01}'s friends fell{03}into Karst's trap.{02}{00}
I know you, {11}{05}.{05}{03}I know that if you leave{03}{11}{01} behind, you'll regret it.{02}{00}
You're not like me. You can't{03}simply discard someone who{03}is no longer of use to you.{02}{00}
Well, you'd better hurry if you{03}still hope to save them.{02}{00}
Everyone recovered fully.{02}{00}
There you go! Consider it a{03}gift. You can still make it.{03}Go on...{02}{00}
It is time you followed your{03}true feelings. Go on.{03}Save your friends.{02}{00}
Even now, I want to run to{03}{11}{04}, to give her my aid...{03}It seems I am weak as well...{01}I suppose I have no choice{03}but to part ways with Agatio{03}and Karst.{02}{00}
{11}{01}... I'm sorry...{03}I can't take any more...{02}{00}
Keep it together, {11}{03}!{02}{00}
Ha! You're a fool! Never let{03}concern distract you in battle!{02}{00}
AHHHHHHHH!!!{02}{00}
We did it, Agatio!{02}{00}
It was close, but we did it.{02}{00}
Heh... He's no warrior. His{03}concern for his friend gave{03}us the opportunity to strike!{02}{00}
What's this? He's still alive!?{03}Even after that blow?{02}{00}
It would be a shame if you{03}and I ever had to regret letting{03}him live...{02}{00}
{11}{01}! Watch out!{02}{00}
He's still alive! If we're going to{03}act, {11}{05}, we have to act now!{02}{00}
They're going to kill {11}{01}!{02}{00}
No, they aren't! I'm not about{03}to let that happen!{02}{00}
None of us are, {11}{06}!{02}{00}
{11}{05}? What's going on?{02}{00}
Be grateful! We just{03}did you a favor!{02}{00}
I understand that when Venus{03}was lit, the ground shook so{03}fiercely that the very earth split.{01}Curious that it hasn't here!{02}{00}
You haven't lit the beacon{03}yet, have you? And after all{03}we've done to help you!{02}{00}
We're going to light the{03}beacon right now...{02}{00}
If that's true, then you'd{03}better go do it!{02}{00}
But we're not leaving{03}{11}{01} behind.{02}{00}
Oh, great... Are you going{03}to betray us now?{1E}{00}
Typical. And you're going to{03}try to stop us from finishing{03}them off, aren't you?{02}{00}
Don't lie... We can see it in{03}your eyes. We can see what{03}you truly mean to do.{02}{00}
If you're only here to clear{03}the way for us to light the{03}beacon, then your work is done.{02}{00}
{11}{01} has proven to{03}be a greater foe than we'd{03}imagined. We can't let him live.{02}{00}
Consider how powerful these two{03}were without the aid of a Water{03}Adept. We have to finish them.{02}{00}
If you want them, you're going{03}to have to face us first!{02}{00}
You're both quite badly{03}injured... You're in no shape{03}to fight all four of them.{01}I think it would be best{03}if you left now.{02}{00}
We haven't much choice...{02}{00}
Karst, no!{02}{00}
Agatio, if we fight {11}{05}{03}now...we'll be destroyed.{02}{00}
{11}{01} killed your sister!{03}Where is your anger!?{02}{00}
I am filled with rage, but not so{03}much as to be blinded by it.{02}{00}
What, then? Do we give up?{02}{00}
Fine! But this is not the end.{02}{00}
Do with {11}{01}{03}as you will.{02}{00}
But swear this oath to us:{03}if we leave now, you will{03}light the beacon's fire.{1E}{00}
I don't care if you want to{03}help {11}{02} or not!{03}The lighthouse comes first!{02}{00}
We do not have time to wait{03}for you to save {11}{02}!{02}{00}
Go, {11}{05}.{03}I will tend to {11}{02}.{02}{00}
And be sure to bring with{03}you the Mars Star that{03}{11}{01} carries on him.{02}{00}
How did you know{03}about the Mars Star?{02}{00}
Did you think this was about{03}nothing more than revenge?{03}Alex told us about it!{02}{00}
Take the Mars Star, or we'll{03}be forced to make you!{02}{00}
Do not force our{03}hand on this!{02}{00}
Go on, {11}{05}. Take it.{02}{00}
I don't know why you're doing{03}this, but I trust you...{03}Take the Mars Star.{02}{00}
{11}{05} took the Mars Star.{02}{00}
That's better, {11}{05}.{03}We'll be waiting for you{03}on the aerie.{02}{00}
{11}{05}, wait...{02}{00}
We cannot trust them.{03}Take me with you...{02}{00}
Good thinking. If something{03}happens up there, you'll be{03}safer with {11}{08}.{02}{00}
We'll be fine. Take{03}{11}{08} with you...{02}{00}
Listen to the others...{03}Safety in numbers, as{03}they say...{02}{00}
{1C}{05}{01}, {11}{05}... No!{03}Why are you helping them?{02}{00}
Don't worry about us... Help{03}{11}{02} and {11}{04} first.{02}{00}
We have to help {11}{02}.{03}He can't hold on for much{03}longer.{02}{00}
{11}{01}! I don't know how{03}you survived that attack,{03}but I'm so glad you did...{01}We're going to help you...{03}We're going to heal you...{02}{00}
{11}{03}... You've been injured.{03}Don't worry about the others.{03}Let's take care of those wounds.{02}{00}
Why did you help us, {11}{05}?{03}Whatever it was, I'm glad you{03}stopped to help us...{01}But why do you have to{03}still light the beacon?{02}{00}
I thought you were our{03}enemy, {11}{05}... Why did{03}you stop to help us?{02}{00}
{11}{02} and {11}{04} are{03}back. They fell through that{03}hole, and then this panel...{02}{00}
{11}{01}! Look at you!{03}You're a mess! I thought I'd{03}never see you again...{02}{00}
You're pretty tough for your{03}age... I'm impressed, {11}{03}.{02}{00}
You're late, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
Now light the beacon!{02}{00}
Once you've lit the beacon,{03}we might even forgive you{03}for saving {11}{01} back there.{02}{00}
Once Jupiter is lit, only{03}Mars remains! Now, light{03}the beacon!{02}{00}
Once Jupiter is lit, we'll have no{03}need for you. Just watch...{02}{00}
Do even think about{03}resisting us... We have{03}our own ideas about that.{01}Once the beacon is lit,{03}your usefulness will have{03}run out for good.{02}{00}
There seems to be a wide{03}hole for the Elemental Star.{01}Cast the Jupiter Star in?{1E}{00}
We have ignited the beacon...{03}The third lighthouse is lit...{03}Now let us go...{02}{00}
I don't think so...{02}{00}
You see, you've betrayed{03}us once already...{02}{00}
We simply can't trust{03}you anymore...{02}{00}
And now that Jupiter{03}Lighthouse is lit, I'm afraid we{03}have little use for traitors.{02}{00}
Poor dear... You look puzzled.{03}Would you like to know{03}why we don't need you?{1E}{00}
I'd be happy to tell you. Mars{03}Lighthouse{05} is in Prox.{02}{00}
Figured it out, have you?{03}Yes, Mars Lighthouse is in{03}Prox.{02}{00}
What are you doing!?{02}{00}
They stole the Mars Star!{02}{00}
Your job is done now.{02}{00}
We're not done yet...{02}{00}
We've got the Mars Star!{03}We don't need you anymore!{02}{00}
You know what that means,{03}of course, don't you?{1E}{00}
Exactly! That means it's{03}time to die, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
No? Well, how can I put this?{03}It's time to die!{02}{00}
But what will happen to{03}{11}{05}'s parents?{02}{00}
We keep our promises! Once all{03}four lighthouses have been{03}lit, we shall release them!{02}{00}
We would never do anything as{03}terrible as breaking our word...{03}as you have done so casually.{02}{00}
But if you're dead...{03}Who will come to take{03}them home from Prox?{02}{00}
I guess they'll just have to spend{03}their remaining years in the{03}frozen wastelands of the north!{02}{00}
Don't worry! They'll be fine!{03}Now prepare for the end!{02}{00}
{11}{05}!{02}{00}
I thought you were taking too{03}long, so I came to check on{03}you. What's going on?{02}{00}
They say they don't{03}need us anymore...{02}{00}
Agatio! {11}{05}'s sister isn't{03}supposed to be here...{02}{00}
What do you want me to{03}do? We can't just leave{03}now! We have to finish them!{02}{00}
Don't worry, {11}{05}!{03}I'm here to help!{02}{00}
{11}{06}!{02}{00}
I got the feeling something was{03}wrong, so I rushed up here. Just{03}in the nick of time, it looks like!{02}{00}
Thank you, {11}{07}! I'm{03}not looking forward to fighting,{03}but I'm glad you're here.{02}{00}
Another one? Agatio, we're{03}rapidly being outnumbered!{02}{00}
It's too late to flee now! We{03}have to keep fighting!{02}{00}
{11}{01} and the others{03}are safe! Now let's take care{03}of these two rats!{02}{00}
We did it...{03}We beat them...{02}{00}
Barely...{02}{00}
What should we do with them?{02}{00}
Finish us!{02}{00}
But think: what happens to{03}your parents if neither we nor{03}Saturos and Menardi return?{02}{00}
Are you saying your people{03}will kill our parents if you don't{03}return to Prox? I doubt that!{02}{00}
Well then, I suppose you'd{03}better finish us off, like I said.{02}{00}
What's the matter? Are you{03}going to do it or not?{1E}{00}
No, {11}{05}! Don't!{02}{00}
You've made the better{03}choice, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
When did you get here, Alex?{02}{00}
If Karst is not bluffing... If you{03}kill them, all of your efforts{03}will have been for naught.{02}{00}
Do you understand, {11}{05}?{03}If that happens, {11}{01} will{03}suffer the same fate you do...{02}{00}
Alex! What are you doing!?{02}{00}
I have revived them.{02}{00}
Why!? Are you going to make{03}us fight them again?{02}{00}
Don't worry, {11}{06}.{03}Look at them... They can barely{03}walk right now.{02}{00}
Still, that doesn't give you{03}the right to...{02}{00}
If you're not going to finish{03}them off, you'll just be leaving{03}them here, won't you?{02}{00}
You're not going to help{03}us defeat these brats?{02}{00}
You'd better not be expecting{03}a big thank-you for this, Alex!{02}{00}
Of course not, Karst.{03}I would never ask for{03}your gratitude.{02}{00}
What's keeping {11}{05}{03}and the others?{02}{00}
We should be going before{03}{11}{01} and the others arrive.{02}{00}
If they're coming up, how do{03}you plan on avoiding them{03}on your way down?{02}{00}
Do not worry about us...{03}We'll just take the elevator.{02}{00}
Now that the lighthouse has{03}been lit, it should be fully{03}operational again.{02}{00}
Oh! You're looking better!{02}{00}
{11}{05}, {11}{06}...{02}{00}
{11}{01}... {11}{02}...{02}{00}
Man! They got away!{03}What a bunch of jerks!{02}{00}
All right, {11}{05}! We want{03}to know what's going on!{02}{00}
It's all quite complicated,{03}{11}{01}. There are a number{03}of{05} extenuating circumstances.{02}{00}
What are you talking{03}about, Kraden?{02}{00}
Look, I don't think any of{03}us are in any shape for{03}another fight right now.{02}{00}
What do you mean, {11}{03}?{02}{00}
I'm just saying we should{03}get ourselves back to Contigo{03}and sort things out there.{02}{00}
That's a sound plan, {11}{03}...{03}I fully agree.{02}{00}
You're right. We can't fight{03}right now. Let's head back{03}to Contigo.{01}What do you say, {11}{05}?{03}Can we talk there?{02}{00}
We'll be waiting for you...{03}So don't think you can{03}sneak off again!{02}{00}
He's right, {11}{05}. It's time{03}we explained ourselves to them.{03}We should go to Contigo.{02}{00}
We'll be there, {11}{01}.{03}I promise. I hope you can{03}still trust me.{02}{00}
I've never stopped trusting{03}you, {11}{06}. I'll be waiting{03}for you in Contigo.{02}{00}
We'll be expecting you. Don't{03}think you can sneak out of this!{03}You owe us an explanation!{02}{00}
{11}{01} wasn't the only{03}surprise. They were all far more{03}powerful than I'd expected.{02}{00}
Don't worry, Karst! We'll win{03}in the end...{02}{00}
This one moved... I can't{03}believe they're still alive!{03}The pests!{02}{00}
If we stay here much longer,{03}{11}{01} and the others{03}will come! We should leave!{02}{00}
I know... But treason deserves{03}death! We must finish them!{02}{00}
There's no time for{03}petty grudges!{02}{00}
Alex! You...{02}{00}
You no longer consider me{03}a friend? I do not care.{02}{00}
It goes beyond that, Alex!{03}You've betrayed us, and{03}treason deserves death!{02}{00}
Yes, I heard you the first time.{01}But shouldn't you heal{03}yourselves before making{03}foolish threats?{02}{00}
After fighting both {11}{01}{03}and {11}{05}, you're in no{03}condition to fight me.{02}{00}
And if {11}{01} and the others{03}come, what chance will you have?{02}{00}
What's keeping {11}{05}{03}and the others?{02}{00}
There's no time to talk!{02}{00}
Then what should we do?{02}{00}
We take the elevator! With{03}the beacon lit, it should be{03}fully operational once more.{02}{00}
We have no choice. Let's go.{02}{00}
Good! You're listening to{03}reason! Now follow me!{02}{00}
{11}{05}! {11}{06}!{02}{00}
What's happened?{02}{00}
It seems they fought with{03}Agatio and Karst...{02}{00}
I had a really bad feeling{03}after {11}{07} left.{03}I hate it when I'm right...{02}{00}
Your power of prediction must{03}be even stronger than you'd{03}thought, {11}{03}...{02}{00}
Blast! They must have taken{03}the elevator to escape!{02}{00}
How could they have done{03}that to {11}{06}? Those monsters!{02}{00}
{11}{05} tried to help us...{03}They must have attacked him{03}because he betrayed them.{02}{00}
So, does that mean {11}{05}{03}isn't really our enemy?{02}{00}
{11}{05}! You're alive!{02}{00}
{11}{04}, he needs healing,{03}quickly! There's still time!{02}{00}
Don't let 'em die! {11}{05}{03}still has a lot of questions to{03}answer before he's in the clear!{02}{00}
If you save {11}{05}, we'll{03}tell you everything...{02}{00}
All right, {11}{05}! We want{03}to know what's going on!{02}{00}
It's all quite complicated,{03}{11}{01}. There are a number{03}of{05} extenuating circumstances.{02}{00}
What are you talking{03}about, Kraden?{02}{00}
Look, I don't think any of{03}us are in any shape for{03}another fight right now.{02}{00}
What do you mean, {11}{03}?{02}{00}
I'm just saying we should{03}get ourselves back to Contigo{03}and sort things out there.{02}{00}
That's a sound plan, {11}{03}...{03}I fully agree.{02}{00}
You're right. We can't fight{03}right now. Let's head back{03}to Contigo.{01}What do you say, {11}{05}?{03}Can we talk there?{02}{00}
We'll be waiting for you...{03}So don't think you can{03}sneak off again!{02}{00}
He's right, {11}{05}. It's time{03}we explained ourselves to them.{03}We should go to Contigo.{02}{00}
We'll be there, {11}{01}.{03}I promise. I hope you can{03}still trust me.{02}{00}
I've never stopped trusting{03}you, {11}{06}. I'll be waiting{03}for you in Contigo.{02}{00}
We'll be expecting you. Don't{03}think you can sneak out of this!{03}You owe us an explanation!{02}{00}
The door's locked.{02}{00}
Holder of the star...{03}Show the power of Anemos!{02}{00}
You didn't warn me that there{03}would be an earthquake when{03}the beacon was lit!{02}{00}
The core is shining so{03}brightly already...{02}{00}
I've heard tales of this...{02}{00}
But I had no idea it would{03}be so spectacular.{02}{00}
I've heard tales of this...{02}{00}
But I had no idea it would{03}be so spectacular.{02}{00}
You're not planning on running{03}away from {11}{01} again, are you?{02}{00}
We can't run anymore, {11}{05}.{03}I promised him that we wouldn't.{02}{00}
Besides, they want to talk,{03}not fight...{02}{00}
They're waiting for us.{03}Let's go to Contigo.{02}{00}
We shouldn't run from {11}{01}{03}anymore, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
Are you looking for {11}{01}?{03}He and his colleagues are in the{03}house at the top of the hill.{01}Are you the people they've{03}been waiting for?{02}{00}
Everyone's left town for the{03}time being. They're transporting{03}the wings...{01}Actually, they might even have{03}finished putting them onto the{03}ship by now.{02}{00}
Is that your boat? It looks{03}exactly like the one in the{03}geoglyphs.{02}{00}
Jupiter Lighthouse has been lit,{03}for the first time in years...{03}Did you feel that earthquake?{01}If that's what happens when{03}the lighthouses shine, I wish{03}that it had stayed dark!{02}{00}
They look like they're in{03}for some trouble. Oh well...{03}I ain't a'gonna help 'em.{02}{00}
The prophecies are all coming{03}true... We're living in some{03}strange times, it seems.{02}{00}
It's just like the legends said...{03}The ship in the geoglyphs has{03}finally come to Contigo.{02}{00}
What does it mean, when{03}ancient legends are turning{03}out to be true?{01}I just want the world to go{03}back to the way it was before.{02}{00}
I'm glad you kept your{03}promise, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
All right, let's hear what he{03}has to say for himself!{02}{00}
What can we say, {11}{01}?{03}Has {11}{05} ever harmed you?{03}Have we ever fought against you?{02}{00}
{11}{05}'s been avoiding you,{03}but he never had any intention{03}of fighting you or anything...{02}{00}
And he definitely helped us out{03}back at Jupiter Lighthouse.{02}{00}
{11}{01}'s been worrying about{03}{11}{06} nonstop since this{03}nightmare began!{01}How could she run away{03}from him like that?{02}{00}
She was afraid that if we{03}met, we would be forced to{03}fight... She didn't want that.{02}{00}
I know that, now... But it doesn't{03}explain why you're doing this...{02}{00}
{11}{05} betrayed his hometown,{03}Vale... That's why he hasn't been{03}able to face {11}{01}.{02}{00}
{11}{05} had hoped to play{03}the villain alone, without getting{03}{11}{06} or me involved...{02}{00}
He betrayed Vale? Kraden,{03}what are you talking about?{02}{00}
He conspired to steal the{03}Elemental Stars and fire the{03}beacons of the four lighthouses.{02}{00}
That's what Saturos and Menardi{03}were trying to do...{02}{00}
Why were you helping them?{02}{00}
Our parents' lives were at{03}stake! We had to help!{02}{00}
Parents? But...your parents died{03}three years ago, in that storm...{02}{00}
That night, Saturos and his men{03}had raided Sol Sanctum... The{03}storm was their doing.{02}{00}
{11}{02}, you saw two{03}strangers that night{B0}Saturos{03}and Menardi.{01}They were the only survivors{03}of Saturos's raiding party.{02}{00}
They had failed to solve the{03}mystery of Sol Sanctum. In doing{03}so, they triggered the storm.{02}{00}
Everyone thought that you{03}were killed by that boulder,{03}{11}{05}.{01}I can't tell you how glad I was{03}to find you were alive!{02}{00}
In fact, nobody was killed{03}by the boulder that day!{02}{00}
So that means...{02}{00}
Wait a minute, Kraden...{03}Did you just say that {09}{02}nobody{07}{03}was killed by that boulder?{02}{00}
But what about {11}{01}'s dad?{03}And {11}{06} and {11}{05}'s parents?{03}I thought they'd died that day!{02}{00}
I'm not so sure now...{02}{00}
Yes! If {11}{05} survived,{03}Kyle and the others may have{03}as well...{02}{00}
Why didn't you tell us? We{03}could have worked together to{03}save your parents, couldn't we?{1E}{00}
Except that we had only just{03}begun our journey, and we{03}simply weren't strong enough.{02}{00}
He's right. They were too{03}powerful then... It would have{03}been impossible.{02}{00}
There's more to it than that.{03}He had another reason to{03}light the lighthouse beacons.{02}{00}
Unless the lighthouse beacons{03}are all lit, Weyard will eventually{03}be destroyed.{02}{00}
Destroyed?{03}But...how? Why?{02}{00}
King Hydros, ruler of Lemuria,{03}says that our world is steadily{03}shrinking.{02}{00}
Elemental energy drives the{03}growth of civilization. Without{03}it, we and our world will wither.{02}{00}
All that because the lighthouses{03}aren't illuminated?{02}{00}
According to my research,{03}that seems to be the case.{02}{00}
But...once the lighthouses{03}are all lit, you said the world{03}would end anyway!{02}{00}
That...might be true, too... But{03}if we do nothing, the world{03}will definitely end.{02}{00}
Wait for the end of the world{03}to come or wind up accidentally{03}triggering it ourselves...{01}What a choice...{02}{00}
Nothing is certain. There is{03}no way to prevent the world{03}from reaching its natural end.{02}{00}
However, we can fight to save{03}the world from withering away{03}due to the actions of men.{02}{00}
And, {11}{05}, you knew this?{03}You were helping them because{03}you knew what was happening?{1E}{00}
You're a lot smarter than{03}I remember you being...{02}{00}
You just figured it out along{03}the way, huh? That's still{03}pretty darned smart.{02}{00}
Why did you wait so long{03}to tell me? I would have{03}helped you...{02}{00}
You wouldn't have done it{03}before, {11}{01}...{01}It would have meant violating{03}the sacred teachings of Vale.{02}{00}
Now that we know all of{03}this, shouldn't we be going?{02}{00}
Hamma!{02}{00}
Hello again...{02}{00}
Hamma! You...know {11}{01}?{03}And his companions, too?{02}{00}
We met at the temple on the{03}edge of the Lamakan Desert...{00}
I'm Hamma, descendant{03}of the Anemos.{00}
I was born in Contigo, and{03}I inherited the power of{03}the Anemos.{02}{00}
Hey... We just got into Contigo,{03}and we found out this is where{03}{11}{03} was born!{02}{00}
Yeah... We also learned{03}that he's got a sister!{02}{00}
Sister... You don't mean...{02}{00}
That would be me, yes.{02}{00}
Not now, {11}{03}...{03}This isn't the time.{02}{00}
Three lighthouses have been{03}lit... The elements have been{03}thrown out of balance.{02}{00}
Jupiter is growing stronger,{03}and the north grows colder{03}with every passing moment.{02}{00}
You must hurry to Mars{03}Lighthouse. Ignite its beacon,{03}before all of Weyard freezes...{02}{00}
Mars Lighthouse? Agatio{03}has the Mars Star. He's{03}on his way to light it now!{02}{00}
I doubt they will be able to{03}light the Mars beacon...{02}{00}
Why's that?{02}{00}
There is a powerful force{03}that does not want to see{03}Mars rekindled.{02}{00}
You will fail as well...unless{03}you pool your strengths{03}together and fight as one.{02}{00}
This is bad.{03}We have to go...now!{02}{00}
I had hoped that you{03}would feel that way...{02}{00}
I've prepared a gift for you,{03}to aid you on your way to{03}Mars Lighthouse.{02}{00}
I must leave you now, but{03}we will meet at the inlet.{02}{00}
I'm sorry we left Venus{03}Lighthouse without seeing you...{03}I'm sorry for making you worry...{02}{00}
Maybe when this is all over, we{03}can all go on a trip together.{02}{00}
Hey, {11}{06}, you sure seem{03}calm, considering that we're{03}racing to meet our enemies...{02}{00}
I'm just relieved that we've{03}sorted our differences...{02}{00}
Me too, {11}{04}... We could{03}not have stood divided{03}against a common foe.{02}{00}
Yeah, I guess I'm a little{03}happy that we're not going{03}to have to beat {11}{05} up.{02}{00}
Listen, this is {11}{05}'s quest{03}now... We're just doing what{03}we can to help out...{02}{00}
Aren't you happy?{1E}{00}
Everything's finally come{03}together... This is how it was{03}meant to be, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
Don't worry about the future,{03}{11}{05}... Enjoy this brief{03}moment's happiness.{02}{00}
But Hamma's waiting for us.{03}Let's go to our ship!{02}{00}
You have to hurry! I think{03}the ship from the geoglyphs{03}is going to take off soon!{02}{00}
First, the lighthouse is lit, and{03}now, we're going to see a{03}flying boat! It's like a festival!{02}{00}
The boss said it was all right{03}for us to go to the inlet once{03}all the customers leave.{01}So hurry up and leave,{03}so we can go watch{03}the boat!{02}{00}
They've finished putting the{03}wings on the boat, but I don't{03}see what the big deal is.{01}It's just a flying boat, for{03}crying out loud!{02}{00}
Once all our customers{03}leave, I'm free to go. So{03}hurry up already!{02}{00}
I can't believe it... All of the{03}hopes of the people of Atteka{03}have come true here, in Contigo!{01}It's like a miracle, a dream{03}come true! This calls for{03}a festival!{02}{00}
All these years, I thought it was{03}just a children's story, but now{03}it's all coming true...{02}{00}
It was kind of impressive{03}watching the procession{03}carrying those wings, though...{02}{00}
A flying ship... Surely, it must{03}be a miracle. I'll have to{03}study this closely.{02}{00}
Perhaps if I see a miracle{03}with my own eyes, my faith{03}will be restored once more...{02}{00}
Hamma returned to Contigo{03}after all these years... Right{03}when we finished the wings!{02}{00}
Was your boat really the same{03}one in the geoglyph? What's{03}that all about?{02}{00}
Everyone's waiting down by{03}the beach.{01}They all want to see the boat{03}fly with their own eyes.{02}{00}
A massive rock blocked the{03}entrance to the inlet after the{03}lighthouse beacon was lit...{01}If that ship's ever going to{03}leave the inlet, it's gonna{03}have to fly to do it.{02}{00}
Where do you think you're going?{02}{00}
We worked really hard{03}on that ship of yours!{02}{00}
I want to see our handiwork{03}take flight. Don't you, buddy?{02}{00}
I want to!  Boy, do I want to!{02}{00}
So hurry up!{03}We want to see the boat fly!{02}{00}
Thanks, buddy!{02}{00}
The villagers are all waiting to{03}see the ship fly. So how's about{03}getting on with the flying!?{02}{00}
Hamma wouldn't let us get{03}any closer, so we're waiting{03}here to watch the ship leave.{02}{00}
When people work together,{03}even a little spiritual power{03}can work great wonders.{01}We sent everyone back to{03}the village so that their hopes{03}would not impair your flight.{02}{00}
We've been working forever{03}on getting these wings{03}onto the boat!{01}We're not used to working like{03}this... It's making me dizzy!{02}{00}
Who built the boat from the{03}geoglyph, anyway?{01}Is there another tribe that's{03}descended from the Anemos{03}besides our tribe in Contigo?{02}{00}
Hamma is the new leader of{03}Contigo. She bears the powers{03}of the Anemos, after all.{01}But I still think she shouldn't{03}be ordering us to help fix{03}up your boat.{02}{00}
If that boat's gonna get out{03}of the inlet, it's gonna have{03}to fly. I want to see that.{02}{00}
It's amazing to think that my{03}hard work is going to help{03}make that boat fly.{02}{00}
Hamma says that our own{03}hopes and dreams might{03}prevent the boat from flying.{01}It's as though, by wanting it{03}too much, we'll actually{03}prevent it from happening.{02}{00}
We can't get too close to{03}the boat, or it might not fly...{01}We've just got to have{03}everyone watch from afar.{02}{00}
It's almost time... Time to{03}watch a legend become reality!{02}{00}
If everyone will just obey{03}Hamma's request, the ship{03}will surely fly.{02}{00}
When the winged ship of Anemos{03}flies once again, the whole land{03}shall be made free...{01}That's what the legend says,{03}anyway... But what land needs{03}freeing? We seem free enough...{02}{00}
Once you remove the stone{03}anchors weighing the ship{03}down, it should fly...{02}{00}
The day has finally come that{03}the ship will fly on the Wings{03}of Anemos...{02}{00}
The Anemos were powerful,{03}sure, but can their power really{03}make a great ship fly?{01}No... No, I must not doubt...{03}I must have faith that it will{03}fly. It is meant to be.{02}{00}
These warriors will know what{03}to do... They'll know how to{03}save the land...{02}{00}
I hear that the warriors brought{03}the Hover Jade back with them...{01}Now, that's something that I'd{03}really like to see.{02}{00}
I've been waiting for you,{03}{11}{05}.{02}{00}
Take a look at your ship.{02}{00}
Now that you have been given{03}wings, all obstacles in your{03}path will vanish forever...{02}{00}
However, it is not the wings{03}alone that grant your ship{03}the power of flight.{02}{00}
Psynergy is the force that{03}powers the Wings of Anemos.{02}{00}
If the ship is to fly, you{03}will need to focus the{03}power of your minds...{02}{00}
You have visited Shaman{03}Village recently, have you not?{02}{00}
Now is the time to make{03}use of the powers you{03}acquired there.{02}{00}
Now... Use the power of{03}Hover to raise your ship!{02}{00}
At first, you may not want to{03}move your ship too high or{03}too far...{02}{00}
It will be difficult at first, but{03}that is to be expected... After{03}all, this is your first flight.{02}{00}
But your quest should not{03}demand much more of you...{02}{00}
Now, be confident{03}and set sail!{02}{00}
All of Contigo is watching...{03}Show them your power, and{03}make your vessel fly!{02}{00}
Use your Psynergy to raise{03}your ship and fly over reefs.{02}{00}
Travel safely, {11}{03}...{03}The world depends on you.{02}{00}
I got stuck doing chores at{03}home, and I had to miss{03}watching the ship take off.{02}{00}
Everyone's been going on{03}about how amazing it was{03}to watch the ship fly...{01}I wish I could have been{03}there to see it. I guess it{03}was pretty moving.{02}{00}
It must be so exciting to{03}travel around the world{03}in a flying ship.{02}{00}
Hamma was telling us that the{03}world is a dangerous place.{03}I wonder what she meant.{01}I think she's concerned about{03}the elemental balance...{02}{00}
I saw the ship fly!{03}Now I want to see what it{03}looks like from on board!{02}{00}
It wasn't what I expected,{03}but seeing the ship take{03}off was still amazing.{02}{00}
I didn't get to see the ship{03}take off, but I'm not really{03}all that disappointed.{01}I heard that it wasn't{03}that impressive anyway.{02}{00}
Some people were talking{03}about how the ship wasn't{03}really that impressive.{01}Why would they say that?{03}A ship actually flew{03}through the air!{02}{00}
I couldn't fly in the air,{03}that's for sure. I get motion{03}sickness just walking around.{02}{00}
I heard that the world could{03}freeze over soon... I hope{03}{11}{03} does what he needs to.{02}{00}
The ship looked like it{03}had a few problems trying{03}to get off the ground.{01}I guess it was because{03}the crew had never made{03}a ship fly before.{02}{00}
All of those legends did{03}nothing but build up people's{03}expectations.{01}I'm just glad to know that{03}the ship flew at all...{02}{00}
I guess the lighthouse was{03}lit because {11}{03} and Hamma{03}finally returned to Contigo.{02}{00}
{11}{03} doesn't remember{03}his mother, because he was{03}taken away at such an early age.{01}But I saw her eyes the day he{03}went away. Tears welled up,{03}and she couldn't stop crying.{02}{00}
From the look on {11}{03}'s{03}face, whatever happened at the{03}lighthouse must have been bad.{02}{00}
Hamma will stay with us, but{03}{11}{03} is leaving again.{01}The power of Anemos must{03}be a terrible responsibility{03}for such a young boy.{02}{00}
I wonder how {11}{03} feels{03}now that he knows what{03}happened to his mother.{01}Hamma seems so closed up...{03}I wonder if she'll talk to him{03}about it...{02}{00}
Someday, I'm gonna fight {11}{03},{03}and then I'll be the legendary{03}hero of Contigo!{02}{00}
{09}{04}Brrr...Brrr... It's been really{03}cold since the lighthouse{03}beacon was lit!{02}{00}
Winter just ended, but{03}it keeps getting colder.{03}What's going on?{02}{00}
Jupiter Lighthouse has been{03}called the beacon of wind... Is{03}that why it's so windy and cold?{02}{00}
Hamma says that if {11}{03}{03}fails, it will continue to get{03}colder and colder.{02}{00}
The lighthouse has been lit,{03}and we've made a ship fly...{03}Our legends are coming to life!{02}{00}
It's up to the people of{03}Contigo to live up to{03}our own legends.{02}{00}
Mom and Dad have been{03}walking around in a daze{03}since the ship took off.{02}{00}
The baby's forehead is{03}furrowed, like it's thinking.{02}{00}
Goo goo. Gaa gaa... Waaa!{02}{00}
Drafts! I hate drafts! This{03}stupid house is always cold!{02}{00}
Now that we've finished the{03}wings, we should fix the house.{02}{00}
{11}{03} has the power of{03}prophecy, but I'll bet he didn't{03}see this coming!{02}{00}
Now that I think about it,{03}this very day will probably{03}become a legend, too!{02}{00}
It's time to fix those drafts{03}now that the wings are done!{02}{00}
Goo... It's getting colder...{03}Gagoo... I want a blanket...{02}{00}
Ah, you've returned! What{03}brings you to my new home?{02}{00}
Hamma...{02}{00}
You're my sister... Why didn't{03}you tell me sooner? Why didn't{03}you tell me when we first met?{02}{00}
You play an important role in{03}all this. If I'd told you, you{03}would have come here too soon.{02}{00}
This place is so familiar...{03}I feel like I've lived here{03}my whole life.{02}{00}
Look at me, {11}{03}.{02}{00}
You're too sentimental.{01}You would have given up your{03}quest to find your true home,{03}and we would all now be lost.{02}{00}
What are you saying, sister?{02}{00}
No, not sister... Do not think of{03}me as your sister until you{03}have fulfilled your destiny.{02}{00}
W-Why?{02}{00}
Our world is falling{03}into ruin...{02}{00}
What? Hamma, what do you{03}mean? What's happening?{02}{00}
Look, I don't want to interrupt{03}your reunion or anything, but...{02}{00}
I couldn't help overhearing{03}you say something about the{03}world falling apart. What's up?{02}{00}
Our world requires a delicate{03}balance of elemental forces.{03}That balance has been disturbed.{02}{00}
Without that balance, one{03}element might be lost beneath{03}the others, straining Weyard.{02}{00}
You're talking about{03}Mars Lighthouse, right?{02}{00}
Isn't Agatio taking care of{03}Mars Lighthouse? Everything{03}should be fine soon.{02}{00}
Agatio will not light{03}Mars Lighthouse.{02}{00}
You don't think he can do it?{02}{00}
No. A great power stands{03}ready to oppose them.{02}{00}
They lack the power to{03}resist that force, and they{03}will fall before it.{02}{00}
But what will happen if{03}Mars Lighthouse isn't lit{03}quickly enough?{02}{00}
Our world will be plunged{03}into ice.{02}{00}
But what would make{03}that happen?{02}{00}
Even I do not know the{03}answer to that question.{02}{00}
Ah... Yes, given the way that{03}the elements interact, I see...{02}{00}
Kraden, you understand?{02}{00}
Well, I'm only guessing...{03}But I think it's a good guess.{02}{00}
Quit fooling around and{03}tell me!{02}{00}
The earth is nurturing and{03}warm. Many creatures are{03}reared in this warmth, you see?{1E}{00}
I follow you...{02}{00}
It's OK, {11}{05}... I don't{03}really get it either, but let's{03}see where he's taking this...{02}{00}
Now, think about the ocean.{03}It is a cold place, is it not?{1E}{00}
Yeah, it is awfully cold...{02}{00}
I don't know what point he's{03}trying to make, but I have to{03}agree that the ocean's cold...{02}{00}
Both lighthouses were lit,{03}and a balance was reached.{02}{00}
But with only the lighthouse{03}of wind lit, the balance has{03}been disturbed.{02}{00}
I get it... Wind cools things down,{03}but it can't heat them up...{02}{00}
When you burn your hand on{03}something hot, you blow on{03}it to cool it off, don't you?{02}{00}
Right, yeah... I've always done{03}that without thinking about{03}it, but it makes sense, huh?{02}{00}
When Mercury Lighthouse was{03}lit, this didn't happen, though.{03}I wonder why...{02}{00}
Water cannot cool things{03}as swiftly as wind, perhaps.{02}{00}
Or maybe the combined power{03}of water and wind is cooling{03}things down even faster...{02}{00}
If what Hamma's saying is{03}true, we'd better get moving{03}again, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
I got too worked up about{03}seeing my sister... Sorry.{02}{00}
It's all right. I'm happy that{03}you cared so much...{02}{00}
All right, {11}{05}! Let's head{03}to Mars Lighthouse!{02}{00}
No matter what happens, you{03}must light the beacon on{03}Mars Lighthouse!{01}I hope for your safe return.{02}{00}
My heart is with you always,{03}{11}{03}. Never forget that.{02}{00}
A cannon? Yeah, I think I heard{03}something about a town up in{03}western Angara having one...{01}A shot fired from that cannon{03}can apparently break even the{03}biggest blocks of ice.{02}{00}
I'd sure like to see the cannon{03}someday. It sounds like a{03}powerful weapon...{02}{00}
Now that the wings are finished,{03}I doubt anyone will be buying{03}any more armor from me.{02}{00}
Well, if there aren't going to be{03}any customers for a while, maybe{03}I'll finally take that vacation.{02}{00}
It's always such a letdown when{03}you finish off a major task like{03}fulfilling an ancient prophecy.{02}{00}
Now that the wings are done,{03}everyone who came to help out{03}has left the village... {02}{00}
All of our work and all of our{03}celebration are finally at an end.{01}I think Contigo is going to go{03}back to being a very quiet place.{02}{00}
The inn has become so lonely{03}now that everyone's gone{03}home.{01}We should have an annual{03}festival in Contigo to{03}commemorate this day!{02}{00}
Gosh... We were so busy,{03}and now we're totally empty.{03}I don't know what to do!{02}{00}
Now's my chance to experiment{03}with some exciting new dishes!{03}What should I make first...{02}{00}
It's going to be a little slow{03}for a while, but I can't really{03}complain, now, can I?{01}After all, I saw the lighthouse{03}shining again, and I actually{03}saw a flying ship!{02}{00}
The inn is bound to be slow{03}for a little while, but business{03}will pick up again.{01}Everyone who witnessed the{03}events of the past few days{03}will want to come back.{02}{00}
What are we going to do?{03}All the excitement is over,{03}and I'm going to be bored!{01}I was starting to like all the{03}attention I was getting!{02}{00}
Seeing that ship take flight{03}was the most moving thing{03}I've ever seen...{01}I think I'll have to preserve{03}it for future generations...{03}in cake form!{02}{00}
It was a miracle that made{03}all of the legends of the{03}Anemos come true...{01}I'm not entirely sure,{03}but I think my faith{03}has been restored!{02}{00}
It was a shock to see{03}such a huge ship float.{01}It made me realize how{03}small we all truly are.{02}{00}
I can't believe that a ship{03}just like the one in the{03}geoglyph actually exists.{01}And I think everyone's proud{03}to have helped to make the{03}legends come true!{02}{00}
That flying ship looked so{03}fake... It didn't look anything{03}like I'd imagined it would.{01}Nobody else was complaining,{03}but they don't pay attention{03}to the details, like I do.{02}{00}
Look closely at the{03}geoglyph. Study it,{03}examine its details...{01}The more you stare at it,{03}the more you recognize the{03}greatness of the Anemos.{02}{00}
I'm convinced there's something{03}hidden in the Sanctum.{01}I just know it says something{03}about it on the wall.{02}{00}
All the amazing things we've{03}seen and done, all the legends{03}that have come true...{01}And I still can't get into{03}the secret chambers of{03}the Anemos Sanctum!!!{02}{00}
He's an odd boy, but I'm glad{03}that {11}{03} has returned{03}to Contigo at last...{02}{00}
We all came together and{03}worked to make the legends{03}come true...{01}It's really inspiring... Actually,{03}it gives me goosebumps...{03}{09}{04}Brrrr...{07}{02}{00}
All right, so we've followed{03}the instructions on the wall,{03}and we {09}{02}still{07} can't get in!{02}{00}
If you tap on the floor or{03}walls, you can hear a hollow{03}sort of sound.{01}I'm convinced that there's{03}nothing on the other side!{02}{00}
{11}{03} was supposed to be{03}a great, manly hero... I guess not{03}all the legends came true...{02}{00}
I've been watching the skies,{03}hoping I could catch another{03}glimpse of the flying ship.{02}{00}
I wonder what's on the other{03}side of the ocean... I should be{03}happy where I am, but...{01}Whenever I think about that{03}flying ship, I want to leave{03}home, to explore the world!{02}{00}
All of our myths and legends{03}have taught us that the sea{03}is a dangerous, fearsome power.{01}But on the day the ship{03}left, the sea was so calm{03}and romantic looking...{02}{00}
You're going north? I hear it's{03}always winter in the lands{03}to the north, so bundle up!{02}{00}
Whenever I look at the sky,{03}I think about that flying ship,{03}and I want to travel the world.{02}{00}
I wish I could travel to the{03}end of the sea on that{03}beautiful flying ship.{02}{00}
Everyone in Contigo used{03}to be afraid of the ocean.{01}But now, everyone who saw the{03}ship take off sees the sea{03}filled with wonder and romance.{02}{00}
I've decided to become...{03}an adventurer!{01}One day, when {11}{03} and his{03}companions return, I will join{03}them on their amazing ship!{02}{00}
The legends tell us that a{03}great calamity brought an{03}end to the Anemos...{01}It had something to do with{03}the light from the lighthouses{03}being extinguished.{02}{00}
That crater behind the village{03}is supposed to be where the{03}city of the Anemos was.{01}The legend says that, one day,{03}it just lifted off the ground and{03}flew away!{02}{00}
The ancient city of the Anemos{03}was located right near the ruins.{01}That crater nearby is where{03}the city once was.{02}{00}
Cities flying up into the{03}sky? I don't buy that for{03}a second!{02}{00}
If a ship can rise up from{03}the sea, why can't a city{03}rise up from the ground?{02}{00}
I've seen a lot of weird{03}things lately... Maybe I ought{03}to listen to those legends.{02}{00}
The city of the Anemos rose up{03}into the sky and became what{03}we now call the Moon.{02}{00}
Wait... The city of Anemos{03}flew up into the sky?{01}All right, that's just stupid!{02}{00}
We did it! The ship took{03}off without a hitch!{02}{00}
Yeah, but...shouldn't it be{03}flying a little higher than this?{02}{00}
Hamma told us that we wouldn't{03}be able to fly very high until we{03}were more familiar with Hover.{02}{00}
Let's see how far we{03}can take this thing!{02}{00}
{11}{07}, what's wrong? You{03}don't look happy...{02}{00}
Do you remember on Idejima,{03}when I told you I had my own{03}reasons for joining your quest?{02}{00}
You were so secretive!{03}Are you going to tell us now?{02}{00}
... ...{02}{00}
You've gone quiet again...{05}{03}It's OK... You don't have to{03}tell us if you're not ready yet.{02}{00}
I thought that if I went to{03}Jupiter Lighthouse, I would{03}learn who I was...{02}{00}
I remember the people of{03}Lalivero talking about how{03}{11}{07} fell from the sky...{02}{00}
All my life, I've been looking{03}for the answer... Where was I{03}born, and why was I abandoned?{02}{00}
You knew {11}{05} was going to{03}Jupiter Lighthouse eventually,{03}and so you went along with him.{02}{00}
But you didn't find any answers,{03}did you, {11}{07}?{02}{00}
I'm sorry, {11}{07}... I was so{03}excited to find Contigo that I{03}didn't consider your feelings.{02}{00}
What? Why is everyone so{03}down all of a sudden?{02}{00}
... ...{02}{00}
Faran raised {11}{07} like his own{03}daughter. He's cared for her{03}ever since he first found her!{02}{00}
Yes, that's true, but...{02}{00}
But you can never be his{03}real daughter, is that it?{02}{00}
{11}{02}! You don't have to{03}be so blunt about it!{02}{00}
No, he's right... I'd want to know{03}my real parents, no matter how{03}caring Faran might have been.{02}{00}
You think so? If it were me, I{03}doubt it'd bother me at all...{02}{00}
{11}{07}, you may not know this,{03}but you and I are very similar...{02}{00}
What do you mean?{02}{00}
Well, it's not exactly the{03}same situation, but...{02}{00}
I was born in a poor village. My{03}memories are hazy, but I still{03}remember it.{02}{00}
I was only four when Babi{03}took me under his wing.{02}{00}
You see, even though I was{03}young, I was quite intelligent.{03}Babi had heard about me...{02}{00}
And Babi took you to Tolbi{03}to further your education, to{03}raise you as a scholar...{02}{00}
I was separated from my parents{03}so early in life... I've never known{03}the comforts of a true home.{02} {00}
Faran has always been like{03}a father to me... I must have{03}been very lucky.{02}{00}
I should say so.{02}{00}
Thank you, Kraden...{03}I feel better now...{02}{00}
I'm glad I could help.{02}{00}
Well, we should be going...{03}Let's hurry on, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
Hey, wait!{02}{00}
Master Hammet requested that{03}I deliver this to {11}{01}, and{03}I totally forgot about it!{02}{00}
Well, you'd better hurry.{02}{00}
I'm supposed to deliver this{03}to {11}{01}... It's not too late, is it?{02}{00}
On my way here, I stopped in{03}Kalay briefly to speak with{03}Master Hammet.{02}{00}
He was quite upset that you{03}hadn't returned to visit him{03}so that he could thank you.{02}{00}
So he requested that I take{03}this with me to Atteka.{02}{00}
It is a gift of thanks from{03}Master Hammet. Take it, please.{02}{00}
Welcome to Loho! We've been{03}excavating all sorts of ores{03}to get the metals inside!{01}The metal used to make the{03}ancient ruins might have come{03}from these very rocks!{02}{00}
We have a lot of important{03}excavations going on, but{03}we're also doing some mining.{02}{00}
Some of the miners found an{03}ancient cannon when they{03}were digging a while back.{01}If you want to see it, it's{03}over by the wall near the{03}ruins.{02} {00}
That wall seems indestructible!{03}We've been trying to dig{03}through it for a while now.{01}We're pretty sure there are{03}some valuable metals and{03}minerals on the other side.{02}{00}
We only settled here a short{03}while ago, and we found all{03}those ruins here...{01}We named our settlement{03}Loho, but I've been wondering{03}what it used to be called...{02}{00}
Everyone in Loho sure loves{03}digging. It's not all mining...{03}We're interested in history, too.{02}{00}
All we need is a way to use{03}the cannon to knock down the{03}wall... That would be great.{01}Then, we could get rid of the{03}cannon altogether. We don't{03}have any use for weapons here.{02}{00}
If we can't get through that{03}wall, we'll never know what's{03}on the other side...{02}{00}
Once we can get through the{03}wall, there will be enough{03}work for everyone in town!{02}{00}
If you want to be a miner,{03}you have to know the earth...{03}You have to know where to dig.{02}{00}
This is the spot. A good hole{03}here, and you'll dig up some{03}fantastic ore...{02}{00}
I haven't found anything worth{03}the trouble of digging up. It's{03}time to find another spot.{02}{00}
If you live in Loho and you{03}don't dig, you're not one of{03}us... You don't belong.{02}{00}
Real experts can find the best{03}spots to dig in a single glance.{02}{00}
Once you've been mining for{03}a while, it's like the ground says{03}to you, "Hey! Hey, you! Dig here!"{02}{00}
I think I'm starting to lose{03}my touch... None of my digs{03}has produced anything at all.{02}{00}
Commerce really took off{03}when we started this mining{03}colony in Loho.{01}You just have to know how{03}to make the most out of{03}what's around you...{02}{00}
Whenever someone strikes{03}gold, we get a rush of visitors,{03}and business just takes off.{02}{00}
If you're only here for{03}the cannon, you can{03}forget about it.{02}{00}
If the cannon is truly as{03}powerful as the people say,{03}we can't just give it away.{02}{00}
We brought the cannon up here{03}to break down the old wall, but{03}we don't have any ammunition...{02}{00}
You can put metal balls in{03}the barrel, but what makes{03}them come out again?{01}It looks a little like an old{03}ballista, but the way it works{03}is totally different.{02}{00}
Did you want this cannon?{1E}{00}
Well, if you can figure out{03}a way to break down this{03}wall, it's all yours.{02}{00}
All we really want to do is{03}break down that wall right{03}there...{01}If we can find someone to do{03}that, we'll give 'im the cannon.{02}{00}
Cannons are so heavy! Why did{03}we bring it up here if we're not{03}going to use it?{02}{00}
What idiot said that we'd be{03}able to destroy that wall if{03}we dragged the cannon up here?{02}{00}
All right, we figured out that{03}you need to put a steel ball in{03}there, but what do you do then?{01}You can stick a ball in there{03}just fine, but I don't think it'll{03}be coming out on its own...{02}{00}
It looks like it's empty.{02}{00}
This can't be used as{03}a cannonball.{02}{00}
Is everyone all right?{02}{00}
Did you hear that? That{03}sound was incredible!{02}{00}
What do you think you're{03}doing, making all that noise?{02}{00}
Hey, look at that!{02}{00}
What are you looking at?{03}It wasn't me! It was the wall!{03}Look at the wall!{02}{00}
The wall... It's gone!{02}{00}
Well, it's mostly gone, yeah...{03}You can get through to the{03}other side now!{02}{00}
How did you manage to{03}break down the wall?{02}{00}
Ah, never mind... What's important{03}here is that we can dig on{03}the other side of the wall now!{02}{00}
Yeah, who cares how it{03}happened? We can dig again!{02}{00}
Well, you did what we asked,{03}so the cannon's all yours!{02}{00}
Hmmm... It's gonna be tough{03}carrying that thing around...{02}{00}
Those guys are new in town, aren't{03}they? Do you think they came{03}from Atteka or Hesperia?{02}{00}
I don't know, but I can tell{03}you they came by boat...{02}{00}
Yeah, I saw one anchored{03}off the beach!{02}{00}
That boat's yours, isn't it?{1E}{00}
Well, why don't you let us{03}get that cannon onto your{03}boat for you, hm?{02}{00}
Look, the only way to get{03}here is by boat, and I see{03}a boat right there!{01}Don't tell me it's not yours!{02}{00}
I don't know why I'm offering,{03}but why don't you let us put{03}it aboard your boat for you?{02}{00}
Was that you that fired{03}the cannon earlier?{01}If you know how to use{03}the cannon, you'll be able{03}to sail in the Northern Sea.{02}{00}
That cannon sure gives off{03}a serious bang! Everyone in{03}Loho was totally shocked!{02}{00}
When we found that cannon{03}at the dig, I thought it was{03}just useless junk.{01}If you know how to use{03}it, it can be a pretty{03}potent tool!{02}{00}
Now that the wall's been{03}breached, we can get on{03}with the mining! Good work!{02}{00}
That cannon can shatter any{03}of the ice floes that keep the{03}ships from trying to sail north.{02}{00}
That cannon was really{03}loud... Imagine if you were{03}standing right next to it!{02}{00}
I don't think we should have{03}given the cannon away. We{03}should have sold it to Tolbi.{02}{00}
We don't have anything to worry{03}about, now that we can start{03}mining in the ruins...{02}{00}
I've gotta go stake myself{03}a claim on the other side{03}of the wall!{01}We've found some valuable{03}metals out here; think what{03}we'll find inside!{02}{00}
You probably only want the{03}cannon so that you can force{03}other people to obey your will.{02}{00}
Ah, so you have a quest to{03}fulfill, do you? I guess that{03}means you're leaving soon.{01}When I was your age,{03}I used to love the life{03}of danger and adventure.{02}{00}
I think we've dug up all{03}that there is out here.{01}I'm going to find myself{03}a new spot inside the wall.{02}{00}
Thanks for opening up{03}the wall... There are some{03}great places to dig out here!{02}{00}
I keep digging up little, tiny{03}gems and metals... But when I{03}get enough, I'll be rich!{01}After all, when you pile up{03}enough dirt, you eventually{03}make a mighty mountain!{02}{00}
Ha ha ha! I've got this giddy{03}feeling, like I'm going to dig{03}up a mountain of money!{01}Whenever I get this feeling,{03}I always dig out a fortune!{02}{00}
I just need to stick to this{03}one spot. Eventually, I'll{03}dig up something valuable!{02}{00}
These guys must be really{03}busy, sailing around all over{03}the world like that.{02}{00}
When they get wherever they're{03}going, they'll tell the world{03}that Loho's got the best metal!{02}{00}
Even at my age, I just{03}love the feel of digging{03}into the earth.{01}Still, when you're not digging{03}up anything good, you start{03}to feel a little frustrated.{02}{00}
I only just started digging,{03}and I'm already wealthy{03}beyond my wildest dreams!{02}{00}
I've hit the mother lode!{03}I keep on digging, and I{03}keep getting more and more!{02}{00}
It doesn't matter how old{03}you get... Nothing beats the{03}feeling of digging a new mine.{02}{00}
I hear you took our cannon{03}in exchange for knocking{03}down that ancient wall.{01}I'll be sorry to see it go...{03}That cannon was going{03}to make Loho famous.{02}{00}
Now, we don't have a symbol{03}anymore... We just have a{03}town full of holes.{02}{00}
You've acquired a splendid{03}cannon. Just be sure that{03}you use it wisely.{02}{00}
It worries me to no end,{03}thinking of the evils one{03}could do with that cannon.{02}{00}
You don't have anything to{03}worry about. We got the cannon{03}onto your ship with no problems.{02}{00}
Now, we're going to start{03}excavating the ground north of{03}the wall you knocked a hole in.{02}{00}
I saw some of the village{03}men carrying the cannon{03}out of town...{02}{00}
I don't know where they were{03}taking it, but I'm glad the{03}cannon's gone...{01}I think they just wanted to{03}make some room for us to{03}begin mining again.{02}{00}
{10} checked the sign{01}It reads "People staying at{03}the inn can check in at the{03}counter.{02}{00}
{11}{05}! Welcome back to{03}Prox! It looks like only Mars{03}Lighthouse still needs lighting...{01}Agatio didn't think you'd be{03}coming back here, so I'm a{03}little surprised to see you...{02}{00}
Agatio and Karst left for{03}Mars Lighthouse a little{03}while ago...{02}{00}
I'm glad you made it back{03}safely... The ice is making it very{03}difficult for anyone to sail here.{02}{00}
We're used to the cold up{03}here in Prox, but lately, it{03}seems to be getting worse.{02}{00}
I've been keeping a close{03}eye on the northern skies...{01}Once I see a bright flash in{03}the distance, I'll know the{03}last beacon has been lit.{02}{00}
Have you seen Saturos or{03}Menardi? People have been{03}saying that they were killed...{02}{00}
{11}{05}, you're back? And you{03}learned how to use Psynergy?{01}I can sense the power{03}inside of you... It's strong!{02}{00}
Once the final lighthouse is lit,{03}the winds should weaken. They{03}keep getting stronger, though!{02}{00}
Agatio and Karst told me that{03}{11}{05} ran away because{03}their quest was too dangerous.{02}{00}
Agatio and Karst are the{03}strongest fighters in Prox...{03}That's why we sent them.{01}But I'm worried... They've been{03}gone for a while now, and the{03}lighthouse still remains dark.{02} {00}
Ever since Agatio returned from{03}Jupiter Lighthouse, the winds{03}have been stronger than ever...{02}{00}
It gets cold around here, but{03}this is the first time I've ever{03}seen snow pile up on the river.{01}What if Agatio doesn't reach{03}Mars Lighthouse in time?{02}{00}
Everything is supposed to{03}return to normal once Mars{03}Lighthouse is lit again.{02}{00}
I can't believe anyone could{03}have beaten Saturos and{03}Menardi...{02}{00}
If {11}{05} could become an{03}Adept so quickly, so can I!{02}{00}
If this weather continues much{03}longer, we'll all be buried under{03}snow in no time.{02}{00}
The rift at Mars Lighthouse{03}gets wider every day.{01}If we don't find a way to{03}stop it, I think it's going to{03}devour Prox entirely!{02}{00}
Our chieftain told me that the{03}rift is growing larger by the day,{03}just like Gaia Falls is.{01}We'd better light the Mars{03}beacon soon, or Prox is{03}finished...{02}{00}
Not too long ago, I climbed{03}the mountains to the north to{03}look at the rift. It was huge!{02}{00}
I thought Prox would be here{03}forever, but now, it looks like{03}it might be destroyed!{02}{00}
Nobody believed that the rift{03}would go as far south as{03}Prox...{01}They all thought Puelle was{03}being melodramatic... But no{03}one thinks that anymore...{02}{00}
The northern rift has gotten{03}so big that I couldn't see the{03}other side...{02}{00}
Prox originally flourished{03}because concerned Adepts lit{03}the fires of the Mars Lighthouse.{01}Now, we, the people of the{03}northern flame, have been{03}forgotten by the outside world.{02}{00}
No one thought about our{03}needs when they extinguished{03}the great lighthouses...{01}Now, because of them, our{03}great land is dying, crumbling{03}away at the edges...{02}{00}
If Mars Lighthouse's fires are{03}not rekindled, Prox will be{03}destroyed, but that's not all...{01}Eventually, Gaia Falls will{03}continue to erode, finally{03}devouring all of Weyard.{02}{00}
When the lighthouses were{03}all extinguished, every great{03}civilization faded away...{02}{00}
To think that we all once{03}had the power to control{03}nature... What fools we were.{02}{00}
I think it's too late for us{03}already... But if they light the{03}fires, we'll be ready for them.{02}{00}
We sent emissaries to Vale{03}to tell them that Weyard{03}was dying.{01}But they wouldn't listen to us...{03}If only they had listened to us...{02}{00}
Vale's elders were stubborn...{03}They refused to listen to us,{03}and they drove us out by force.{01}We had gone in peace, hoping{03}to convince them of the plight{03}our world faces...{02}{00}
At least the journey wasn't{03}for nothing. We learned that Sol{03}Sanctum held a hidden secret.{02}{00}
Three years ago, we sent our{03}finest to Sol Sanctum. All but{03}two were killed in a trap.{01}The people of Vale couldn't{03}possibly understand how dire{03}our need was...{02}{00}
{11}{05}, you like igloos, right?{02}{00}
You {09}{02}would{07} say that...{03}You come from somewhere{03}warm and sunny!{01}We didn't have anything to{03}play with, so we just decided{03}to make this thing...{02}{00}
Well, if you don't like cold{03}things, you're in the wrong{03}place!{01}We just built this so that{03}we'd have something to{03}do to keep us warm...{02}{00}
The wind is so cold and{03}bitter that we decided to{03}hide out inside our igloo...{02}{00}
My parents told me that it{03}would do me good to get some{03}fresh air, but I'm freezing!{02}{00}
Those poor children. They{03}don't understand what's about{03}to happen to us...{01}I just want them to be happy{03}in the short time left to us.{02}{00}
I hate igloos, but at least{03}it's protecting us from the{03}wind...{02}{00}
Mama and Papa have been{03}acting really strange lately...{03}They seem so sad.{01}Whenever I ask them what's{03}wrong, they tell me to go{03}outside and play some more.{02}{00}
I always catch a cold when I'm{03}outside in weather like this...{03}Does Mom want me to get sick?{02}{00}
I can't bring myself to tell{03}them what's going to happen{03}to us...{05} Oh, please, save us...{02}{00}
Puelle, our chieftain, grew{03}worried about Agatio and{03}Karst.{01}He's gone to the northern{03}edge of town to wait for them.{02}{00}
The people Saturos rescued{03}from the storm in Vale should{03}be waiting in their room.{01}Once Mars Lighthouse has{03}been lit, they'll be free to{03}return home.{02}{00}
Don't forget, {11}{05}, your{03}mother and father are staying{03}in the north end of Prox.{02}{00}
Now that Saturos and his{03}team are gone, Agatio is the{03}last of our warriors.{01}If something happens to{03}them, our final hope is lost.{02}{00}
Mars is the last lighthouse{03}that needs to be rekindled.{01}Once that's been taken care{03}of, the people of Vale will be{03}set free.{02}{00}
Saturos used {11}{05}'s parents{03}to force {11}{05} to follow him{03}on his mission.{01}We've fallen on hard times{03}when we need to coerce{03}people to join our cause.{02}{00}
They're not here...{02}{00}
Strange... We looked all over{03}the village, and we can't find{03}any trace of them at all...{02}{00}
Everyone says they've{03}practically vanished without{03}a trace... It's so strange.{02}{00}
You don't think they...{02}{00}
They wouldn't have gone to{03}the lighthouse...{02}{00}
Yeah, you're probably right.{02}{00}
Puelle's going to be upset{03}that we didn't follow his{03}order to free them, though.{02}{00}
He was clear about it, too...{03}"When {11}{05} returns to Prox,{03}set his parents free."{02}{00}
Puelle ordered me to set{03}your parents free. That's{03}why I'm here now...{01}The only thing is, no one{03}else is here... I don't know{03}where your parents went!{02}{00}
{11}{05} took the trouble of{03}coming back for his parents,{03}and now they're just gone?{02}{00}
Puelle wanted to set {11}{05}'s{03}parents free before Prox{03}was destroyed...{01}But if we can't find them,{03}how can we set them free?{02}{00}
I can't think of anywhere{03}else {11}{05}'s parents{03}might have gone!{02}{00}
When you left Prox, you were{03}so young that you could barely{03}lift a sword!{01}Now, look at you! You could{03}handle any weapon with ease!{02}{00}
You go away for a little{03}while, and you come back{03}a strong and mighty warrior!{01}I'm so proud of you!{02}{00}
What has he gone through{03}that he's become so strong{03}in such a short time?{02}{00}
{11}{05} looks so confident,{03}so bold... You can see it in{03}his eyes...{02}{00}
{11}{05}, your parents have{03}gone away... They were very{03}worried about you.{02}{00}
Your mother knows that you're{03}strong and healthy, so I'm sure{03}she's very relieved...{02}{00}
{11}{05}'s parents{03}were worried about him when{03}they heard Saturos was dead.{02}{00}
{11}{05}'s parents were{03}so worried about him that{03}they were wasting away...{02}{00}
I hear Agatio and Karst have{03}gone to Mars Lighthouse...{01}What if their actions only{03}cause more turmoil? How can{03}we be sure they're right?{02}{00}
These catastrophes are{03}the result of the lighthouse{03}beacons being rekindled.{01}This snow, this wind, it all{03}started after Jupiter{03}Lighthouse was lit.{02}{00}
We can't wait for Agatio{03}and his men any longer...{02}{00}
If we wait much longer, this wind{03}and snow will make it impossible{03}to reach the lighthouse.{02}{00}
I'm going to the lighthouse...{03}Will any of you come{03}with me?{02}{00}
Puelle, I can't let you{03}go on your own...{02}{00}
If something were to{03}happen to you, who{03}would lead our village?{02}{00}
Please, you must let us{03}go in your stead.{02}{00}
How can you expect to{03}accomplish what Agatio{03}and Karst could not?{02}{00}
They may have been more{03}powerful than any of us, but{03}we can't just stand by!{02}{00}
They're not coming back,{03}just like Saturos... You have{03}to let us try.{02}{00}
I can't. I can't allow it.{02}{00}
Listen to your elder...{03}He speaks wisely.{02}{00}
I'm speaking to you too, Puelle.{02}{00}
If Agatio and Karst cannot{03}do the task, how can you, a{03}single man, hope to do it?{02}{00}
What are you saying?{03}If we stand around debating,{03}our town is doomed for certain!{02}{00}
We can't risk sacrificing{03}any more lives.{02}{00}
So, we must sit here and{03}wait for a miracle to come.{02}{00}
Is that you, {11}{05}? When{03}did you return to Prox?{01}You should take your parents{03}back to Vale, so they can at{03}least die in their hometown.{02}{00}
If we were better Adepts,{03}we could try to enter the{03}lighthouse ourselves...{02}{00}
I feel so helpless... Agatio has{03}not returned, and the lighthouse{03}beacon remains unlit.{02}{00}
All we can do now is wait{03}for Agatio and his men to{03}return...{01}But no honest soldier can{03}sit idly by while others do{03}all of the work.{02}{00}
Our Psynergy feels weak...{03}I can sense it inside me.{01}The water, earth, and wind{03}lighthouses have been lit,{03}and fire alone remains dark.{02}{00}
Puelle promised that he{03}would return our hostages{03}to Vale.{01}If you don't believe me,{03}ask him yourself.{02}{00}
If the lighthouse isn't lit{03}soon, Prox is doomed...{03}I need to get out of here!{02}{00}
Neither our elder nor Puelle{03}will tell us what's going on{03}at the lighthouse...{01}Why are we training so{03}much? A lighthouse shouldn't{03}pose that much danger...{02}{00}
Puelle is stronger than any{03}of us, and there is nothing{03}he can do to save us...{01}But if we don't take some{03}kind of action, Prox will be{03}destroyed for sure...{02}{00}
If they didn't light the beacon{03}and they didn't return home,{03}Agatio's team must have failed.{02}{00}
If only my fire Psynergy{03}weren't so weak now, I{03}might be able to help...{02}{00}
Puelle never intended to take{03}hostages. He wanted the people{03}of Vale to be returned safely.{01}Saturos insisted that we{03}hold on to them for our{03}safety, but Puelle disagreed.{02}{00}
You... {11}{05}, it's you...{02}{00}
I'd heard that you had returned{03}to us... You look so much{03}stronger than when you left.{02}{00}
It seems he has brought{03}some allies with him.{02}{00}
Yes... I am Kraden.{02}{00}
My name is {11}{01}.{02}{00}
{11}{01}... Isn't that...{02}{00}
That is the name of the one{03}Agatio said had killed Saturos{03}and Menardi.{02}{00}
{11}{01}, stop that...{02}{00}
You are correct, but{03}{11}{01} had reasons{03}for fighting them.{02}{00}
Saturos and Menardi had{03}invaded Vale, stolen its sacred{03}treasure, triggered a volcano...{02}{00}
You cannot blame {11}{01} for{03}pursuing them and fighting{03}to regain what they had stolen.{02}{00}
We only wanted to stop them...{03}We didn't think they'd fight{03}us to the death.{02}{00}
They flung themselves into the{03}opening of Venus Lighthouse's{03}beacon...{02}{00}
Did...Saturos and Menardi{03}put up a good fight?{02}{00}
I'll bet you thought you{03}didn't stand a chance{03}against them, huh?{02}{00}
You were probably really{03}tense the whole time...{02}{00}
Saturos and Menardi had a{03}job to do... That was all.{02}{00}
If I'd been in your shoes, I'd{03}have done the same thing...{03}I can't blame you.{02}{00}
And in the end, you were stronger{03}than they were... You should be{03}proud of that.{02}{00}
I am sad that they lost their{03}lives in their quest, but there{03}was no avoiding it.{02}{00}
What has happened cannot{03}be undone. We should cooperate{03}to find a way to save Weyard.{02}{00}
We understand that Agatio{03}and Karst have made for Mars{03}Lighthouse and not returned.{02}{00}
Then all that remains for us{03}is to wait until Gaia Falls{03}carries us all to our doom.{02}{00}
It seems that Mars Lighthouse{03}is as dangerous as all the rest.{02}{00}
We have only a few soldiers{03}remaining, and none who can{03}make the climb to the aerie.{02}{00}
Only Saturos and perhaps{03}Agatio were strong enough{03}to reach the top...{02}{00}
And none of them can{03}help us now.{02}{00}
You think we can do it?{1E}{00}
I agree, {11}{05}...{02}{00}
{11}{05}, what are you{03}thinking?{02}{00}
We've climbed three lighthouses{03}already... What's one more? Let's{03}go to Mars Lighthouse!{02}{00}
They've proven themselves{03}strong enough! I say we trust{03}in {11}{05} to do this!{02}{00}
This is an unexpected turn of{03}events, but yes, I think you{03}can light the lighthouse...{02}{00}
Off to the Mars Lighthouse!{03}Let's go, {11}{05}!{03}Come on, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
There is one thing that I{03}don't want you to forget.{02}{00}
In order to light the beacon{03}at Mars Lighthouse, you will{03}need to have the Mars Star.{02}{00}
Ah! And Agatio and Karst{03}have the Mars Star now!{02}{00}
You must find Agatio and{03}Karst, and you must take{03}the Mars Star from them.{02}{00}
Thanks for your help.{03}The future of Weyard{03}rests in your hands.{02}{00}
You must find Karst,{03}get the Mars Star, and{03}light the lighthouse.{02}{00}
{11}{05}, you are the only{03}hope left to us now.{03}Good luck.{02}{00}
If this doesn't work, we're all{03}finished... Prox, Weyard, even{03}Vale... All will be lost...{02}{00}
If they were strong enough to{03}defeat Saturos and Menardi,{03}perhaps they can do the job...{02}{00}
Why... Why am I lying here?{02}{00}
Wait, I think I remember... We{03}were going to light the beacon...{02}{00}
But the lighthouse was frozen.{03}We wandered lost inside,{03}trying to find the aerie...{02}{00}
We must hurry... If we{03}delay, Prox is destroyed.{02}{00}
It's no use... I'm absolutely{03}drained... I can't even stand.{02}{00}
And the cold... Why am I so cold?{03}We of the Fire Clan are meant{03}to be immune to the cold...{02}{00}
I feel the cold too, Karst...{03}I... I'm afraid we're going{03}to die up here...{02}{00}
I can feel it now... The long,{03}dark sleep creeping into{03}my soul...{02}{00}
Wait... I think{03}I remember...{02}{00}
The eye... It told us that we{03}lack the will to go any farther.{02}{00}
The eye... I remember now...{03}I felt its gaze pierce me to{03}the core, then all went black...{02} {00}
That's right... And I remember{03}fighting against {11}{05}...{02}{00}
I do, too... Was it a dream?{03}An illusion?{02}{00}
{11}{05}? Is that you?{1E}{00}
Amazing... Then our luck hasn't{03}entirely run out yet...{02}{00}
How can you play games{03}with us like this?{01}Regardless, it's amazing that{03}you're here... It means our luck{03}hasn't entirely run out yet...{02}{00}
{11}{05}, you must complete{03}our quest... Please... You have{03}to light the beacon...{02}{00}
We can't even stand... We're in{03}no condition to go on. Light{03}the beacon for us... Please.{02}{00}
You'll need the Mars Star.{03}Go on... Take it.{02}{00}
Please hurry... If I can just see{03}the light of the beacon, I'll know{03}that I haven't died in vain.{02}{00}
We're counting on you...{02}{00}
It's too late for us now...{03}Hurry, light the beacon.{02}{00}
Your hand...so warm...{03}People have such warm{03}hands... I had forgotten...{02}{00}
I'm so tired... A fog is rising{03}before my eyes... No! Can't{03}die until the beacon...is lit...{02}{00}
I'm so cold, colder than I ever{03}thought possible... All because{03}Mars Lighthouse remains unlit...{01}I have to stay alive...long{03}enough to see its light...{02}{00}
You who hold the star,{03}open your heart and listen...{01}If you wish to reach the heavens,{03}give your star to me.{02}{00}
If you do not hold the star,{03}you shall not ascend to the{03}heavens... Begone!{02}{00}
You who hold the star,{03}open your heart and listen...{02}{00}
If you wish to scale the{03}heavens, set the four{03}spirits aflame!{02}{00}
Mankind... With the power of{03}wisdom, they ruled the earth.{02}{00}
Fish... With cold courage,{03}they ruled the water.{02}{00}
Dragons... Burning with might,{03}they ruled the fires.{02}{00}
Bird... On the wings of truth,{03}they ruled the winds.{02}{00}
You have proven your worth!{03}The heavens await you!{02}{00}
Betrayers, you have arrived!{02}{00}
Who said that!?{02}{00}
The wind's too strong!{03}I can't see anything!{02}{00}
I heard it too, but I don't{03}see anyone else up here!{02}{00}
{11}{05}! Quick! Cast the Mars{03}Star in before anything{03}has a chance to stop us!{02}{00}
So, you are still intent on lighting{03}the beacon of Mars Lighthouse?{02}{00}
Who said that!?{02}{00}
Have you forgotten me so soon,{03}{11}{01}? And you, {11}{02}?{02}{00}
It seems to know you,{03}{11}{01}... Do you have any{03}idea what it is?{02}{00}
Then search your heart, boy!{02}{00}
That voice...{02}{00}
It's...the Wise One!{02}{00}
{11}{01}, since when are{03}you on a first-name basis{03}with the Wise One?{02}{00}
It must have been{05}.{05}.{05}. {11}{01},{03}what happened in Sol Sanctum{03}after we were kidnapped?{02}{00}
When Saturos and Menardi stole{03}the Elemental Stars, they also{03}triggered a volcanic eruption.{01}The Wise One prevented Mt. Aleph{03}from erupting so that {11}{02}{03}and I could escape.{02}{00}
But...wait, Mt. Aleph {09}{02}did{07} erupt!{03}There was a huge explosion! We{03}saw it all the way in Vault!{02}{00}
But it would have erupted with{03}us still inside... There was no way{03}we could have escaped in time.{02}{00}
The Wise One held off the{03}eruption until we could escape...{03}He even halted the lava flow.{02}{00}
I can't believe it... Nobody has{03}enough power to do that...{02}{00}
I know it sounds weird, but I{03}was there, and it happened, so{03}you'll just have to believe us!{02}{00}
If it can do all that, this{03}Wise One seems more like{03}a god than an Adept!{02}{00}
I did not just save you. I also{03}tasked you with recovering the{03}four Elemental Stars.{02}{00}
Why have you disobeyed my{03}command? Why have you come{03}to light the beacon?{02}{00}
Because Prox will be{03}destroyed if we don't! We{03}can't let that happen...{02}{00}
Prox? They have brought this{03}disaster upon themselves.{02}{00}
Are you saying we should just{03}abandon them to die? What{03}did they do to deserve that!?{02}{00}
The people of Prox have{03}committed an unforgivable{03}sin. They must pay the price.{02}{00}
For lighting the lighthouses?{03}Is that their sin? Does that{03}warrant total destruction?{02}{00}
If we don't light the beacon,{03}Gaia Falls will eventually{03}erode away all of Weyard!{02}{00}
We have fought for so long to{03}save all the people of our world,{03}and now you would stop us?{02}{00}
Gaia Falls is growing.{03}It's consuming more and{03}more with each passing day!{02}{00}
How can you just allow{03}the world to crumble into{03}nothingness?{02}{00}
The seal needs to be{03}broken! The world will be{03}destroyed if it's not!{02}{00}
You have learned{03}far too much.{02}{00}
Wise One! You can't continue{03}to protect the lighthouses! You{03}know what's happening!{02}{00}
It is your duty to protect all of{03}Weyard! If Weyard is destroyed,{03}you will have failed us all!{02}{00}
Why won't you answer{03}us, Wise One?{02}{00}
If Alchemy is unleashed,{03}mankind may well destroy{03}all of Weyard itself.{02}{00}
But we can combine our{03}strengths, ensure that Alchemy{03}not be used for evil...{02}{00}
It is inevitable. In time, one man{03}will seek to rule over all. It is{03}human nature, inescapable.{02}{00}
And it shall come sooner{03}than any of you think.{02}{00}
Why do you say that?{02}{00}
The Water Adept who climbs{03}toward the peak of Mt. Aleph{03}even as we speak...{01}Is he not a friend of yours?{02}{00}
Alex is his name. Surely,{03}you have not forgotten him?{02}{00}
Alex!? What would he be{03}doing on Mt. Aleph?{02}{00}
He understands far more than{03}you do. He knows that when{03}the four beacons have been lit...{01}Their light will gather{03}at Sol Sanctum.{02}{00}
But what would he gain{03}from being there?{02}{00}
When the final beam of light{03}reaches the peak of Mt. Aleph,{03}the Golden Sun shall rise.{02}{00}
The Golden Sun!?{03}What is that? And what{03}would Alex want with it?{02}{00}
When the four beams merge{03}into one, they form a golden{03}light, bathing Mt. Aleph's peak.{02}{00}
Is... Is that Alchemy? I mean,{03}pure Alchemy made real, at{03}the heart of its power?{02}{00}
And it's that light that gives{03}shape to the Stone of Sages?{02}{00}
This has been Alex's one true{03}desire from the very start.{02}{00}
Alex planned all of this?{03}Then he must have been{03}after this power all along!{02}{00}
We've been duped! He used us all!{03}Oh, you'd better believe he's{03}not getting away with this!{02}{00}
Alex... How could he do this?{03}He's... He's one of my own{03}people! I feel sick...disgusted...{02}{00}
None of that matters right now.{03}We still have to light the beacon.{03}We don't have any choice.{02}{00}
If we don't do it now, Prox{03}will be destroyed!{03}{11}{05}... We have to, right?{1E}{00}
You bet we do! The Wise One{03}will have to deal with Alex{03}on his own.{02}{00}
{11}{05}! We don't have any{03}choice! The Wise One will have{03}to deal with Alex himself.{02}{00}
I cannot interfere in the{03}actions of mankind.{02}{00}
If you can't interfere, then how{03}about getting out of our way so{03}we can light the beacon, huh?{02}{00}
Ooo... Good one, {11}{06}!{02}{00}
I don't like doing exactly what{03}Alex wants, but it's looking like{03}we've got no choice...{02}{00}
Don't worry, {11}{05}!{03}Just throw the Mars Star into{03}the beacon's well! Now!{1E}{00}
The Wise One himself said{03}he's not allowed to interfere!{03}You're all clear!{02}{00}
Wise One! Didn't you just say{03}that you aren't allowed to{03}interfere with our actions?{02}{00}
That is correct.{03}I cannot stop you.{02}{00}
But...what if some miracle were{03}to occur, one that prevented you{03}from igniting the beacon?{02}{00}
Miracle? What are you talking{03}about? What kind of miracle?{02}{00}
If you can defeat a miracle,{03}only then can you ignite the{03}beacon's flame.{02}{00}
The Wise One is up to something!{03}Be wary, everyone! We don't{03}know what he's capable of!{02}{00}
A three-headed dragon?{03}{09}{02}That's{07} your miracle?{02}{00}
So you would have us fight{03}for our future? Fine, then{03}fight we shall!{02}{00}
What's he thinking? We already{03}beat a two-headed dragon. How{03}much tougher can this one be?{02}{00}
I don't care how many heads{03}it has. Nothing's going to{03}stop us now!{02}{00}
Let's do it! For Prox!{03}For the future of Weyard!{02}{00}
Wait a second... Wasn't that{03}two-headed dragon actually{05}.{05}.{05}.{01}So that means this three-{03}headed dragon must be...{02}{00}
{11}{05}! NO! You mustn't{03}fight that dragon! It's{B0}{02}{00}
Too late, Kraden! We can't{03}get away from it now!{02}{00}
{11}{05}, don't! Stop!!!{02}{00}
...Who are they?{02}{00}
That's what I was trying{03}to warn you about!{02}{00}
It wasn't just the dragon{03}you killed...{02}{00}
I remember you warning us,{03}but it was too late for us to{03}stop...{02}{00}
Kraden, what do you know?{03}Why were you trying to stop{03}us from fighting the dragon?{02}{00}
It was the Wise One's{03}final trap...{02}{00}
Trap? What do you mean?{02}{00}
The Wise One knew he couldn't{03}stop you, so he played a cruel,{03}wretched trick on you instead.{02}{00}
Kraden, I don't understand...{03}What are you trying to tell us?{02}{00}
{11}{07}, let's see who{03}those people are while they{03}try to sort this out.{02}{00}
No, {11}{06}! Don't look!{03}You mustn't look! It will only{03}bring you pain...{02}{00}
What are you talking about,{03}Kraden? They can't hurt us{03}anymore... We'll just{B0}{02}{00}
What's the matter, {11}{06}?{02}{00}
It...can't be... How? How...{02}{00}
Nnn... Uhnnn...{02}{00}
What is it, {11}{01}?{02}{00}
Uhhh...unnnn...{02}{00}
{11}{01}! I... I know{03}that guy! That's your dad!{02}{00}
Then...does that mean...{03}the other two are...{02}{00}
Hhnnnng...{02}{00}
Hhhnnn...{02}{00}
Mom... Dad...{02}{00}
I'll heal {11}{06}'s parents!{03}Quickly, {11}{04}! Tend to{03}{11}{01}'s father!{02}{00}
If only... If only I'd realized{03}it sooner...{02}{00}
What's the matter, {11}{08}?{03}Why did you stop? {11}{06}'s{03}parents need you...{02}{00}
Don't give up, {11}{04}. You{03}can't! You have to save them...{02}{00}
It's no use, {11}{03}...{03}I'm tapped...{02}{00}
I am, too... And even if I weren't,{05}{03}it's just too late...{02}{00}
What are you saying!?{02}{00}
They're not...{03}They can't be...{02}{00}
That's not what I'm saying,{03}{11}{06}... I...{02}{00}
I finally found them... I was{03}going to be with them again...{03}For the first time in years...{02}{00}
{11}{06}...{02}{00}
Please... It can't be...{02}{00}
Mom... Wake up!{03}It's me... It's {11}{06}!{03}...Don't leave me...{02}{00}
{11}{06}, you must prepare{03}yourself for what comes next...{02}{00}
Being transformed into a dragon,{03}fighting in that form... This{03}requires tremendous power.{02}{00}
What are you saying, Kraden?{02}{00}
In fighting you, your parents{03}were forced to use every{03}last ounce of their energy.{02}{00}
They don't have the strength to...{02}{00}
Even if they had won the battle,{03}they would not have survived.{03}You cannot blame yourself...{02}{00}
You monster!!!{02}{00}
Why did you do this? Why{03}did you make us fight{03}{11}{06}'s parents?{02}{00}
You're no god! You're no{03}protector! You're evil!{02}{00}
You don't understand the pain{03}you have caused, Wise One.{02}{00}
You have no idea the damage{03}done to a child who learns she{03}has destroyed her own parents.{02}{00}
That's enough...{02}{00}
I knew what I was doing the{03}moment I raised my sword.{02}{00}
We defied the Wise One in{03}order to save the world.{03}Our parents would understand.{02}{00}
Don't you think so, {11}{05}?{1E}{00}
You're right. It hurts, but it's true.{03}We didn't do this for ourselves.{03}We did it for all of Weyard.{02}{00}
I agree with my brother...{03}But it does no one any good{03}if we don't complete our task.{02}{00}
We still have a chance to{03}save Prox.{02}{00}
Perhaps we can't save your{03}parents, but we can save{03}countless others.{02}{00}
Kyle and the others saved{03}them, too... They sacrificed their{03}lives so that we could go on.{02}{00}
I never imagined that{03}my actions would help{03}to save the world...{02}{00}
Even though lighting the beacon{03}may create wars and strife,{03}I regret none of this.{02}{00}
There's little time left, {11}{05}...{03}Use the Mars Star and{03}light the beacon.{02}{00}
Our quest is almost over.{03}I...don't know how I'm going{03}to tell Mom about this...{01}But sorrow can wait. We've{03}got to light the beacon.{02}{00}
I wish I could console you{03}somehow... It must be tough...{01}I just wish I'd had one last{03}chance to have some of{03}{11}{05}'s mother's cookies.{02}{00}
{11}{05}, I understand your{03}loss...{01}But remember, you and {11}{06}{03}still have each other.{02}{00}
If Alex set this all in motion,{03}then he's responsible for this,{03}and I'll never forgive him.{02}{00}
I thought I'd get to see my{03}parents again... I thought I'd{03}get to hold them again...{01}But instead, we were{03}forced to destroy them...{02}{00}
I don't know my parents...{03}They might be alive, somewhere{03}out there... But I share your pain.{02}{00}
I'm sorry things had to end{03}up like this, {11}{06}.{02}{00}
Both Kyle and your parents{03}were very dear to me. My{03}sorrow joins yours, friends.{01}We must light the beacon, if for{03}no other reason than to provide{03}them with a proper funeral.{02}{00}
Unnnn... {11}{05}?{03}...{11}{06}?{01}I am so happy...to have one{03}last chance to see you again...{03}in the end...{02}{00}
Uhhhhnnn... {11}{05}...{03}I...can't see you, but I sense that{03}you're nearby...{01}Please... Take care of{03}{11}{06} for us...{02}{00}
*Koff! Koff!* {11}{05}...{03}You made it back...alive...{03}Please, I must ask one last thing...{01}Tell Dora...to live her life{03}to the fullest...for me...{02}{00}
Do not let your sadness{03}overwhelm you, {11}{05}!{01}Go! Once the beacon has been{03}ignited, you can mourn as much{03}as you need. I will protect you.{02}{00}
Will you cast in the Mars Star?{1E}{00}
The beacon is lit!{02}{00}
And to think, I joined this quest{03}hoping to prevent exactly this{03}from happening...{02}{00}
And I began this quest as a{03}prisoner, taken against my will.{02}{00}
And if that tidal wave hadn't{03}sent me far off course, I{03}wouldn't even be here now.{02}{00}
How many lives have been{03}taken and changed forever{03}just to light this beacon?{02}{00}
Mom... Dad...{03}Weyard is safe now.{02}{00}
You're right!{03}I hear voices, too!{02}{00}
I told you...{03}I told you I could hear them!{02}{00}
Who said that?{03}Where are you?!{02}{00}
We're in Imil! We're at the{03}base of Mercury Lighthouse!{02}{00}
You... You can't be!{02}{00}
You... You can't be!{02}{00}
Hey! I know that voice!{03}It's {11}{04}, I just{03}know it!{05} {11}{04}!!!{02}{00}
It's you!{02}{00}
Of course it's us! We can hear{03}you, {11}{04}! You're all{03}right! I'm so happy!{02}{00}
Who are those two{03}kids talking to?{02}{00}
I don't know. They've been{03}standing here telling everyone{03}to leave the lighthouse.{01}...Weird couple of kids{03}if you ask me!{02}{00}
How is it that we{03}can hear you?{02}{00}
I don't know, but he told us{03}we'd be able to talk to you{03}if we came here now.{02}{00}
He? Who's "he"?{02}{00}
I don't know... We were sleeping,{03}and he came to us in a dream...{01}He said, "Go to the lighthouse!"{02}{00}
The lighthouse? Why?{02}{00}
He said that we have to{03}deliver a message... He was{03}too busy to do it himself...{02}{00}
What message?{02}{00}
We have to warn everyone to{03}stay clear of the lighthouses!{02}{00}
What's going to happen?{02}{00}
I don't know, but he told us{03}to warn people away from{03}Mt. Aleph as well!{02}{00}
But who is "he"!? You{03}still haven't told us!!!{02}{00}
You're a meanie! I don't{03}tell meanies anything!{02}{00}
Don't pay any attention to{03}him... It's me, {11}{04}... Can you{03}tell me who spoke to you?{02}{00}
I told you, I don't know, but{03}he looked like a big rock...{03}with a big, rocky eye!{02}{00}
The... The Wise One!{02}{00}
What could he be doing?{02}{00}
Of course! I understand...{02}{00}
The Wise One said that when{03}all four lighthouses have been{03}lit, the Golden Sun will shine...{02}{00}
When that happens, Mt. Aleph{03}and the lighthouses will probably{03}become quite dangerous...{02}{00}
So, the Wise One is warning{03}people in dreams, telling{03}them to seek refuge?{02}{00}
Why would he do that!? You{03}saw what he did to us... He{03}can't be up to anything good...{02}{00}
Have you not learned?{03}One's actions do not always{03}reveal one's true intentions.{02}{00}
Hamma...{05} Sister...{02}{00}
Master Hamma! Did you receive{03}a message, too?{02}{00}
Yes. I was called to Jupiter{03}Lighthouse in a dream.{02}{00}
You have completed your{03}quest, but I see it comes{03}with great loss...{01}Your suffering has been{03}almost unbearable.{02}{00}
Master Hamma... My parents...{02}{00}
I know, {11}{06}, and I am sorry.{03}But do not give up hope{03}for them just yet...{02}{00}
What do you mean,{03}Master Hamma?{02}{00}
Appearances can be an{03}illusion... The Wise One{03}has a caring heart.{02}{00}
He forced us to fight{03}{11}{01}'s and {11}{06}'s parents!{03}What's so "caring" about that!?{02}{00}
If the Wise One were truly evil,{03}he would not be warning me{03}of danger in my dreams.{02}{00}
Well, I... I guess not... But{03}then, what's he up to?{02}{00}
We do not have time to{03}discuss it right now.{02}{00}
She's right.{01}If the Wise One said it's not{03}safe to be near the lighthouses,{03}then I think we should listen.{02}{00}
I am heading for safety, too.{03}All of you must get away{03}from the lighthouse now.{02}{00}
Hurry, everyone! Let's go!{02}{00}
What about our parents?{02}{00}
We can't leave them behind...{02}{00}
I understand how you feel, but{03}we won't make it if we have{03}to take them with us!{02}{00}
Make the decision, {11}{05}!{03}Should we take them with us?{1E}{00}
It's too dangerous...{03}The Golden Sun is forming!{02}{00}
A ray of light is emanating{03}from the beacon... From the{03}Mars Star.{02}{00}
What will happen?{02}{00}
The power of Alchemy will{03}be unleashed upon the world!{02}{00}
We must take {11}{01}'s{03}father and {11}{06}'s{03}parents and flee!{02}{00}
Stop it! Let go of my wrist!{02}{00}
{11}{02}, get a grip!{03}No one's touching you!{02}{00}
I'm serious! I...{02}{00}
The beacon!{02}{00}
{11}{06}... We have to{03}move your parents!{02}{00}
Mom! Dad!{02}{00}
What's happening?{02}{00}
There's no time for questions!{03}Just carry them!{03}Carry them and go!{02}{00}
There's a space for you{03}to place something.{02}{00}
{11}{05} got the Mars Star!{02}{00}
{11}{05} used the Mars Star!{02}{00}
{10} checked the ice.{01}{00}
A shaft of ice is poking{03}up through the floor.{02}{00}
Thank you, {11}{05}.{03}And you, too, {11}{01}{03}and Kraden.{02}{00}
By igniting Mars Lighthouse,{03}you stopped Gaia Falls{03}from devouring our town.{02}{00}
We're just glad to have helped{03}save Weyard...{02}{00}
You've been through many{03}trials, more than any of us{03}can ever know...{02}{00}
We had no idea what to{03}expect when we lit the{03}final beacon...{02}{00}
When we saw the flash of{03}the beacon, we had no idea{03}what you suffered to light it...{02}{00}
I thought we were done for...{03}There was no way we could{03}escape with our parents' bodies.{02}{00}
Well, at least, not if we hadn't{03}pulled together and overcome{03}our sorrows...{02}{00}
That light was brilliant!{02}{00}
You know, I shall always regret{03}that I didn't get to look upon{03}the beacon's light from afar...{02}{00}
I understand your regret... As{03}a scholar of Alchemy, you would{03}have been most impressed.{02}{00}
I saw the beams of blue, red,{03}and purple streaming out{03}toward the southeast...{02}{00}
That's the direction in which{03}Vale lies, is it not? Was the{03}light headed to your hometown?{02}{00}
Indeed it was. The Wise One{03}said the beams were going to{03}merge into one above Mt. Aleph.{02}{00}
The orb of golden light{03}we saw... That was shining{03}directly over Vale?{02}{00}
Yes. That was the Golden{03}Sun forming over Mt. Aleph.{02}{00}
If I remember the{03}tales correctly...{01}The Golden Sun is the blast of{03}light emitted at the very moment{03}the Stone of Sages forms...{02}{00}
Such legends exist even{03}here? I wish that I'd known{03}that sooner!{02}{00}
I fear for Vale, to think that all{03}this energy is being released{03}right over your hometown.{02}{00}
We're all worried about that.{03}We're hoping we can return to{03}Vale as quickly as possible.{02}{00}
Oh... Is there nothing we can{03}do to convince you to stay?{02}{00}
We had hoped you might stay{03}in Prox a while, but that sounds{03}unlikely...{02}{00}
Don't worry... We plan on{03}returning as soon as things{03}quiet down, don't we?{1E}{00}
Our village will not soon forget{03}that you saved us from the edge{03}of destruction. Do visit us again.{02}{00}
You have just completed a{03}long and difficult journey.{01}Perhaps when you are older,{03}and you look back on your youth,{03}you will remember us fondly...{02}{00}
When that time comes, I may{03}no longer be in this world.{02}{00}
Don't say such things... I'm{03}sure a long life awaits you.{02}{00}
Well, I suppose we should{03}be departing for Vale soon.{02}{00}
You're right, Kraden...{03}If we don't, you-know-who{03}might start causing trouble...{02}{00}
At least some of your cares{03}have been remedied...{01}You must be glad to know{03}we've brought all three{03}back from the brink of death.{02}{00}
I would not have thought it{03}possible had I not seen it.{02}{00}
Even I do not fully{03}understand it...{02}{00}
But their can be no doubt. The{03}fire Psynergy released by the{03}beacon rekindled their spirits.{02}{00}
I hadn't expected so much{03}Psynergy to be released by{03}the lighthouse's beam...{02}{00}
I have no real explanation,{03}other than that their life force{03}had not been fully extinguished.{01}It was a miracle, but the{03}fire Psynergy seems to have{03}recharged them somehow.{02}{00}
And had your parents not been{03}Adepts, the wave of Psynergy{03}would have passed them by.{02}{00}
{11}{01}! What's taking you{03}two so long? Don't keep me{03}waiting!{02}{00}
Uh-oh! It's {11}{06}...{03}We're late, and she looks{03}rather displeased with us.{02}{00}
Should I let her know{03}we're leaving now?{1E}{00}
I'm sorry! We're almost done.{03}Can you wait for us at the{03}village gates with the others?{02}{00}
I'm serious! If I have to wait{03}much longer, you're not{03}going to be happy!{02}{00}
I'm sorry, {11}{06}! It sounds{03}like things are going to take{03}just a little bit longer...{02}{00}
Well, I'm not going to wait much{03}longer! If you don't come soon,{03}we're all leaving without you!{02}{00}
I'll wait outside with them.{02}{00}
I don't think they want to{03}wait anymore, {11}{05}.{03}We're all set to head home...{02}{00}
They have no patience{03}whatsoever. Ah, well...{03}I suppose it is time to leave.{02}{00}
May your journey home{03}be safe and uneventful...{02}{00}
We shall never forget what{03}you have done for Prox.{02}{00}
Thank you for lighting the{03}fires of the lighthouse beacon,{03}{11}{05}. You saved us all.{02}{00}
It's too bad about Agatio{03}and Karst...{01}They weren't bad people... A{03}little obsessed, yeah, but it's{03}still sad that they're gone.{02}{00}
I don't remember the last{03}time I saw the sky this bright{03}and clear. It feels wonderful!{02}{00}
Winter in Prox can be bitter{03}cold, but I think things will{03}feel more mild after this.{02}{00}
I was so moved when I saw{03}that light shining from the{03}north. We all owe you our lives.{02}{00}
The lighthouses have all been{03}lit... Does that mean we're going{03}to fall back into war and chaos?{02}{00}
You did an amazing job... You{03}accomplished what Agatio and{03}Karst could not...{02}{00}
Will you be going back to Vale{03}now that your quest is over,{03}{11}{05}? Don't forget us!{02}{00}
{11}{05} has proven{03}himself as the strongest{03}warrior Prox has ever known!{02}{00}
I heard the Karst and Agatio{03}were defeated by a monstrous{03}dragon...{01}{11}{05} beat the dragon,{03}though... I don't know whether{03}I'm impressed or scared of him.{02}{00}
The blizzard's finally over...{03}That was the worst patch of{03}weather we've ever had!{02}{00}
Now that our weather is{03}returning to normal, maybe{03}everyone will move back here.{02}{00}
I was the first person in town{03}to see the lighthouse! I was{03}so happy, I had to tell everyone!{01}I felt like a little boy again,{03}running giddily through{03}town, shouting and waving!{02}{00}
They had no choice... They{03}had to light the four{03}elemental lighthouses...{01}Even though it might mean{03}a rise in war and violence,{03}it had to be done.{02}{00}
When {11}{05} left town, he{03}of a fighter... He wasn't much{03}of anything, really...{01}When did he become{03}mightier than the mightiest{03}of Prox's warriors?{02}{00}
I bet {11}{05} and his friends{03}live in a nice, warm place... I{03}wish I could go with them.{02}{00}
I think the rift to the north{03}started receding when the{03}lighthouse was lit...{02}{00}
I wonder if that hole up{03}north has stopped growing...{03}What if it starts again?{02}{00}
The lighthouse was so beautiful{03}when the beacon was lit... It{03}made a beautiful band of light!{02}{00}
I was afraid the falls were{03}going to gobble me up!{03}I'm glad that's over now...{02}{00}
What do we do if the falls{03}start expanding again and{03}{11}{05} isn't here?{01}Oh, great... That's going to{03}keep me up all night worrying.{02}{00}
All the lights joined up{03}together and shot off to{03}the southeast.{01}It looked like they all{03}formed into a big, golden{03}ball or something.{02}{00}
I've been told that lighting{03}the four beacons has set{03}Alchemy free on the world.{01}Now that we all can use{03}Alchemy again, civilization is{03}going to make great strides!{02}{00}
I guess the four lighthouses{03}were the seal that blocked{03}the power of Alchemy.{01}So not only did {11}{05} save{03}Prox, he's also brought{03}about a new golden age!{02}{00}
The people of Prox won't{03}forget what you've done{03}for them...{01}You can return home to{03}Vale with great pride, but you'll{03}always be welcome here.{02}{00}
Alchemy has been freed. We{03}must begin researching it{03}in earnest here in Prox.{02}{00}
Now that Alchemy is free,{03}it's like Weyard is waking up!{03}How will the world change?{02}{00}
{11}{05} and his allies{03}saved us from certain{03}destruction.{01}It's a shame the rest of the{03}world doesn't know how much{03}they've done for us all.{02}{00}
{11}{05}, take some advice{03}from an old man...{01}You would do well not to tell{03}anyone that you were the ones{03}to light the beacons...{02}{00}
{11}{01} and his friends left{03}Vale having sworn to return{03}with the Elemental Stars.{01}When they return, they'll have{03}to tell everyone what happened.{03}I hope they won't be punished...{02}{00}
If they found out {11}{05} used{03}the treasures of Sol Sanctum{03}to light the beacons...{01}That fool of a mayor would{03}no doubt punish them for{03}what they did to save us.{02}{00}
The mayor and the elders in{03}Vale are so out of touch.{01}When they see {11}{05} and{03}his friends return without the{03}stones, they'll punish them.{02}{00}
Weeee! What fun! Now that{03}it's stopped snowing, we{03}can go outside and play.{02}{00}
I miss running around outside.{03}It's been so cold, I can't even{03}work up a good sweat.{02}{00}
If I'm going to be a great{03}warrior, like {11}{05}, I'm gonna{03}have to train hard.{02}{00}
I can hear the sound of{03}children playing far off{03}in the distance...{01}That sound means that{03}everything's back to normal{03}and our worries are past.{02}{00}
Now that the lighthouse is lit,{03}we don't have to play in{03}that stupid igloo anymore.{02}{00}
That blizzard was unreal,{03}but it's gone now, and the{03}weather's beautiful.{02}{00}
You get more exercise running{03}in the snow, because it's a lot{03}harder to do.{02}{00}
It's been so long since{03}children's voices rang{03}through our streets.{01}I hope these children{03}remain ignorant of how much{03}danger we were all in...{02}{00}
I have much to do, so I{03}won't be able to see you{03}off, but I wish you safe journey.{02}{00}
Your body has absorbed a{03}great deal of raw elemental{03}energy. Please be careful.{02}{00}
There's no telling what could{03}happen now... If you absorbed{03}energy, maybe {11}{06} did, too...{01}Which means you'd better{03}not make her angry, or you'll{03}really get it!{02}{00}
{11}{05}, I always thought{03}of you as my very own grandson{03}when you were here...{01}Now that you're leaving, I can't{03}describe the sorrow that fills{03}this old man's heart.{02}{00}
Think of your old grandma's{03}cooking every now and then{03}when you're back home in Vale.{02}{00}
We may have underestimated{03}the power of the Psynergy he{03}unleashed...{01}We'll have to study it more{03}closely once we've seen{03}{11}{05} on his way.{02}{00}
The power to revive the dead...{03}It's an awesome and terrifying{03}power indeed...{01}Eternal life could soon be in{03}the hands of Alchemists{03}everywhere... What a thought!{02}{00}
We've lost so many soldiers,{03}and now {11}{05} is leaving...{03}It's going to be quiet in Prox.{02}{00}
Who knew that the poor, injured{03}boy they brought back from Vale{03}would be the one to save Prox?{01}I'm happy that he'll finally{03}be able to return home, but{03}I'll miss him so...{02}{00}
I'm so sad... {11}{05} doesn't{03}even have time to enjoy{03}this last meal I made him...{02}{00}
Thank you so much, {11}{05}!{03}If you hadn't returned to us,{03}we wouldn't be here now!{02}{00}
Your foster grandmother knew{03}that you would return. She{03}always said you were reliable.{02}{00}
I never imagined that little{03}{11}{05} would become stronger{03}even than Agatio and Karst.{02}{00}
It's too bad {11}{05} can't{03}stick around... He'd make the{03}perfect son-in-law.{02}{00}
We had no idea there would{03}be such a terrible earthquake{03}when the beacon was lit.{01}My wife tumbled right into my{03}arms... It was like we were{03}teenagers all over again!{02}{00}
After that earthquake, I feel{03}like I aged a couple of years{03}in just a few minutes!{02}{00}
We'll never be able to thank{03}{11}{05} and the warriors{03}of Vale enough.{01}I hope they're all happy to{03}be home with their families{03}in Vale again.{02}{00}
When the earthquake hit,{03}{11}{05} and his friends{03}were high up on the lighthouse.{01}If that had been me up there,{03}I think my heart would have{03}stopped from fear!{02}{00}
Now that the lighthouse has{03}been lit, I fear for what will{03}happen to Weyard.{02}{00}
The lighthouses are going{03}to restore the power of{03}Alchemy to the land...{01}But Alchemy is too terrible{03}a power to set free...{02}{00}
Sorry, {11}{05}, but this road{03}is blocked off right now.{02}{00}
If you're worried about the{03}lighthouse beacon, don't...{03}It's still lit.{02}{00}
I just don't think I'm cut out{03}to be a soldier. I should have{03}taken up knitting instead.{02}{00}
{11}{05} taught me a lot{03}about how to be a serious{03}soldier...{01}I've been going easy on myself,{03}but no more! I'm going to train{03}harder every day!{02}{00}
Even just standing outside the{03}lighthouse, I can feel the energy{03}coming from within...{02}{00}
Well, you look like you're all{03}set for the return trip to Vale.{03}Travel well, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
The road to the lighthouse{03}is in terrible shape after{03}the earthquake...{01}I've got no clue how {11}{05}{03}and the others made it back{03}to town on that road.{02}{00}
The elders were saying that{03}the lighthouse beacon is tough{03}to put out once it's lit.{02}{00}
On the other hand, now that{03}Alchemy is free, maybe I{03}should study Alchemy...{02}{00}
Maybe if I train hard enough,{03}I'll be as strong as Menardi{03}and Karst were...{02}{00}
If the light of the beacon{03}keeps shining, the power{03}of Alchemy will never end...{01}Even if Prox is attacked,{03}the bright flames of our{03}strength will burn on.{02}{00}
When {11}{05} left Prox, I didn't{03}think much of him, but now,{03}he's totally hot!{02}{00}
What took you so long?{03}Mom and Dad are tired{03}of waiting for you...{02}{00}
That's not true, {11}{05}. You take{03}as long as you need to say{03}farewell to the people of Prox.{02}{00}
Don't worry about us, {11}{05}...{03}Puelle and the others took{03}good care of us.{02}{00}
Don't tell him that! We'll be{03}stuck here forever!{02}{00}
You look like you're feeling back{03}to your old self, {11}{06}!{02}{00}
You were weeping such{03}mournful tears after the battle...{02}{00}
What!? As if!{03}You can't prove anything!{02}{00}
Go easy on her. You have to{03}remember, she thought that{03}both of her parents had died.{02}{00}
Oh, were you crying, {11}{06}?{02}{00}
No! I said...{03}I said I wasn't!{02}{00}
Now you've got me thinking{03}about my family... I didn't think{03}I'd miss them this much...{02}{00}
I only hope that they're all{03}safe back in Vale...{02}{00}
I just want to be home again...{03}I want to see how my mother{03}is doing...{02}{00}
Don't worry, Son. I'm sure{03}Dora's doing fine. She's a{03}strong woman.{02}{00}
But last time I saw her, she{03}looked so sick, so weak...{01}Even if nothing happened{03}to Vale, I'm still worried...{02}{00}
Don't worry, {11}{01}. I'm sure{03}she's in wonderful shape.{01}I think she'll be surprised{03}to see me!{02}{00}
And she wouldn't let anything{03}happen until you came home.{02}{00}
Sorry to keep you all waiting.{03}At last, the time has come for{03}us to return to Vale...{02}{00}
As soon as we leave Prox,{03}we'll head toward Angara, and{03}from there, to Vale...{02}{00}
I can't wait to see this{03}winged ship of yours! It{03}sounds so incredible!{02}{00}
I remember so little of our{03}trip to Prox... This is really{03}my first voyage on a ship.{02}{00}
I've heard that the wind and{03}waves make the boat rock...{03}I hope I don't get sick...{02}{00}
This ancient ship of ours{03}actually flies above the{03}ocean... It's quite a cozy ride.{02}{00}
It looks like we've got{03}an exciting last trip{03}ahead of us, doesn't it?{1E}{00}
Wow... Setting out like this{03}takes me back to our own{03}quest's start... It was so long ago.{02}{00}
I'm still worried about my{03}mother, but I'll try to put it{03}aside and enjoy the trip.{02}{00}
If you keep talking like this,{03}we'll never go anywhere!{03}Let's go, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
What's the matter, boys?{03}Are you reluctant to depart?{1E}{00}
It's hard to believe that our{03}quest is almost at its end.{03}I know how you feel.{02}{00}
After all that we've been{03}through, you can't possibly be{03}nervous about this small trip!{02}{00}
I just hope that Vale came out{03}of this in as good a condition{03}as Prox did...{02}{00}
We won't know until we get there.{02}{00}
I can't stop thinking about{03}how my parents are doing...{02}{00}
Were the both of them in Vale?{02}{00}
Can't you make a guess, Kraden?{03}Will Vale still be standing{03}when we arrive?{02}{00}
Not even I can know that...{02}{00}
I can see it in your eyes,{03}Kraden! You think something's{03}happened, don't you?{02}{00}
It's a possibility... One that{03}cannot be ignored...{02}{00}
If it's not there, then what's{03}the point in even going back?{02}{00}
Is that really how you{03}feel, {11}{01}? What about{03}you, {11}{05}?{1E}{00}
Have you already forgotten all{03}that we discussed? You ought{03}to refresh your memory!{02}{00}
You remember, don't you,{03}{11}{05}? Think about it{03}for a moment, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
What do you mean?{02}{00}
Our conversation with Hamma{03}after we ignited the beacon...{02}{00}
Don't you remember us talking{03}to the children from Imil at the{03}base of Mercury Lighthouse?{02}{00}
When they were warning people{03}away from the lighthouses?{02}{00}
Yes. The Wise One instructed{03}everyone to seek refuge.{02}{00}
Yeah, so what about it?{02}{00}
You still don't see, {11}{02}?{02}{00}
Even if Vale were destroyed,{03}I'd expect that the villagers{03}have all escaped to safety.{02}{00}
I guess that's true... They{03}might still be all right.{02}{00}
That's true... So whatever{03}happens, my family's alive!{02}{00}
I'd forgotten about that...{03}Thanks, Kraden.{02}{00}
{11}{02}, can you make sure{03}everyone else knows that?{02}{00}
OK, let's go. The both of you!{03}We have to catch up to{03}everyone.{02}{00}
Kraden...{02}{00}
Why did the Wise One change{03}our parents into a dragon? Why{03}did he make us fight them?{02}{00}
I mean, we almost killed them...{03}He tried to make us kill our{03}own parents. Why?{02}{00}
Do you think that he intended{03}for them to die from the start?{1E}{00}
I cannot speak for him, but I{03}think he knew that they would{03}be revived by the beacon's light.{02}{00}
Ah... You don't understand why{03}he put you through all this if{03}he knew they'd survive...{02}{00}
We cannot hope to fathom the{03}motives of a being as all-{03}powerful as the Wise One...{02}{00}
You don't know either, Kraden?{02}{00}
I can only hazard a guess...{03}The Wise One...{03}wanted to test you.{02}{00}
What do you mean, test us?{02}{00}
I cannot tell you more... It is{03}up to you to find the answer.{02}{00}
Will we use Alchemy to wage{03}war, to raise armies?{01}Or will we use it to grow wise,{03}to rise above our petty feuds{03}and perform great deeds?{02}{00}
You were willing to sacrifice{03}everything for your quest. I'd say{03}you've risen to this challenge.{02}{00}
Oops! Is everyone else that{03}far ahead of us?{02}{00}
We'd better hurry and catch{03}up to the others before they{03}leave us behind!{02}{00}
After all, I'm not terribly{03}interested in trying to walk{03}all the way back to Vale.{02}{00}
If you feel the same, then{03}we'd better be hurrying.{02}{00}
{11}{01}! {11}{05}!{03}We're off!{02}{00}
Kraden, come look at this...{03}There's a huge ice wall{03}blocking our path...{02}{00}
Hm... If we can't do something{03}about that wall, we're not going{03}any farther, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
Kraden, come look at this...{03}There's a huge ice wall{03}blocking our path...{02}{00}
Nothing to worry about,{03}{11}{06}. We'll just have to{03}use that cannon we got in Loho!{02}{00}
That's right! If the cannon can{03}blast away a stone wall, think{03}what it'll do to ice!{02}{00}
{11}{05}, take us between those{03}two blocks of ice for shelter{03}when you fire the cannon.{02}{00}
We should be safe if we{03}fire from this distance.{02}{00}
OK, here we go! {11}{05}, aim{03}right at the ice wall and fire{03}when ready!{1E}{00}
What? You're not ready yet?{03}Take your time and get{03}into position then...{01}But as soon as you're{03}ready, fire!{02}{00}
Fire the Magma Ball!{02}{00}
Great! We did it! We{03}can keep going now!{02}{00}
All right, let's head for{03}the Northern Seas.{02}{00}
Let's go!{02}{00}
The Golden Sun... The very{03}quintessence of Alchemy's{03}power! It's beginning!{02}{00}
Wait for me! Please, wait!{03}Wait until I reach the{03}summit of Mt. Aleph!{02}{00}
At last! I have it!{03}Eternal life...and{03}limitless power!{02}{00}
At last, the power of nature{03}is mine to control as I will!{02}{00}
Rise, storms! Rise up and{03}unleash your might upon Vale{03}and the foothills of Mt. Aleph!{02}{00}
That's odd... I should have{03}limitless power... So why can't{03}I call up a simple storm?{02}{00}
Wh-Who are you?{02}{00}
I am called the Wise One...{02}{00}
The Wise One? Vale's protector?{02}{00}
You wish to have limitless power?{02}{00}
Wish to?{03}I just got it!{02}{00}
No. Your power is nearly{03}limitless, but it has boundaries.{02}{00}
Nearly limitless? You speak{03}in riddles. Can't you see?{03}The power is mine!{02}{00}
Yes. You also have nearly endless{03}life. And your Psynergy is...{03}somewhat stronger.{02}{00}
If you are trying to anger me,{03}have a little taste of exactly how{03}much power I have attained!{02}{00}
Look at me! My body is{03}brimming with power!{02}{00}
How!? What's going on?{03}I should be all-powerful!{03}How can you defeat me?!?{02}{00}
You are not all-powerful, Alex.{03}Your power has its limits, as{03}does your life.{02}{00}
That cannot be! Who is{03}responsible for this treachery?{03}Who has robbed me of my dream?{02}{00}
I, the Wise One, imbued the Mars{03}Star with some of the power{03}of the forming Golden Sun.{01}It rests even now in the hands{03}of young {11}{01}.{02}{00}
Why?{02}{00}
The heavens and earth are{03}changing, Alex! You must{03}flee{05} now!{02}{00}
Wha-What!?{02}{00}
Mt. Aleph will soon be drawn{03}into the heart of the earth! You{03}must flee or join it forever!{02}{00}
Flee?! I can't flee!{05}{03}I can't even move!{02}{00}
Ah, yes. You now see the limits of{03}your power. If you are swallowed{03}by the earth, you may not survive.{02}{00}
If you survive, perhaps we{03}shall meet again someday...{02}{00}
We're heading to Tolbi. We hear{03}there's a tournament there{03}called Colosso.{01}I'm Morgan, and this here's{03}Dekka. We're gonna compete,{03}and we're gonna win!{02}{00}
Hey, if you see a gladiator{03}named {11}{01}, give him{03}a message for me...{01}If he's thinking about going{03}to Colosso this year, he doesn't{03}stand a chance of winning!{02}{00}
The gladiator who takes the{03}prize in Colosso earns quite{03}a reputation as a warrior...{01}Mercenaries get a lot more{03}jobs when they've got a{03}good reputation.{02}{00}
We fought in Colosso last{03}year, but we lost to a weaselly{03}little kid named {11}{01}.{01}We're after revenge, so we've{03}been out on a risky journey to{03}increase our fighting strength.{02}{00}
I found {11}{01}!{02}{00}
We've been looking for{03}you, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
Who are you guys?{02}{00}
The name's Satrage. You{03}took me out in the last{03}round at Colosso.{02}{00}
And I'm Azart!{02}{00}
And don't forget Navampa!{02}{00}
Oh. It's you guys.{02}{00}
Is that any way to say{03}hello to some old friends?{02}{00}
What's your problem?{02}{00}
We want to talk to you{03}about your fighting style{03}at Colosso.{02}{00}
Yeah. And we think you shouldn't{03}have won, {11}{01}. We think{03}you didn't fight fair.{02}{00}
It sounds like you resent the{03}fact that {11}{01} beat you...{02}{00}
We've just been thinking about{03}it, and there's no way that{03}{11}{01} should have won!{02}{00}
Right. So you think I cheated{03}just because I used my{03}Pynergy abilities in Colosso?{02}{00}
I don't know how you did{03}it. I'm just sayin' I think{03}you cheated is all...{02}{00}
Ah, but Psynergy is a warrior's{03}skill, every bit as much as your{03}sword arts. It isn't cheating.{02}{00}
You're not listening, are you,{03}old man? That fight was fixed,{03}and we're here to pay you back!{02}{00}
Hey, these guys aren't{03}very strong at all!{02}{00}
Ha! We were right! They{03}{09}{02}were{07} cheating at Colosso!{1E}{00}
I knew it!{02}{00}
It takes a lot to reach the{03}finals at Colosso... A lot more{03}than you guys can take.{02}{00}
You look like you've got{03}business in here, but there's{03}no way you're getting past us.{02}{00}
Give it up! We're staying here.{03}We've got our eyes peeled, and{03}there's no way you're getting in!{02}{00}
These guys were phenomenal!{02}{00}
Which one of you didn't think{03}they won Colosso fair and{03}square?{02}{00}
It wasn't me! I think both you{03}and Navampa were saying{03}something like that.{02}{00}
So. You don't still think our{03}victory at Colosso was fixed,{03}do you?{02}{00}
No way, {11}{01}! We've seen{03}the error of our ways!{02}{00}
We promise we won't badmouth{03}you or call you a fraud ever{03}again. Will you forgive us?{1E}{00}
Don't be that way! We've{03}learned our lesson! Forgive us!{1E}{00}
You're not such a bad{03}kid after all!{02}{00}
You came out here looking{03}for treasure, didn't you?{02}{00}
Here, this was in the chest{03}we found.{02}{00}
You were nice enough to{03}forgive us, so we think you{03}should have it.{02}{00}
Right, well... I guess we'll{03}be leaving now.{02}{00}
By the time the next Colosso{03}rolls around, we ought to be{03}strong enough to win for sure!{02}{00}
Maybe we'll see you there.{02}{00}
{11}{01}!{02}{00}
{11}{01}, is it you? Do my{03}eyes deceive me?{1E}{00}
Oh. I must have been mistaken.{02}{00}
No, you are not{03}{11}{01}, are you?{02}{00}
Young lady, are you looking{03}for someone by the name{03}of {11}{01}?{02}{00}
Yes, old man! I am looking{03}for one called {11}{01}!{02}{00}
Where is {11}{01}?{02}{00}
I'm sorry... {11}{01} isn't{03}with us...{02}{00}
Well then, where can I{03}find {11}{01}?{02}{00}
Why do you want to find{03}him so badly?{02}{00}
Me? I am Feizhi... {11}{01}{03}helped me once.{02}{00}
He helped Ulmuch. Ulmuch was{03}trapped, but {11}{01} saved him.{03}He is a brave man, isn't he?{02}{00}
I suppose... But why are you{03}looking for him? Do you{05}{03}like him? Is that it?{02}{00}
You're a mean old man. It is{03}not polite to tease me.{02}{00}
That's what it is! You{03}like {11}{01}!{02}{00}
No! I am so embarrassed!{02}{00}
Don't worry, Feizhi... We'll tell{03}{11}{01} how you feel!{02}{00}
I...{05} Really?{02}{00}
Then...will you give him{03}this when you tell him?{02}{00}
What is it?{02}{00}
{11}{01} is on a dangerous{03}journey. I am worried about him,{03}so I made him a good luck charm.{02}{00}
Ah, a good luck charm... I see.{02}{00}
I am going home now, old man.{03}Thank you for doing this favor{03}for me.{02}{00}
Legends said that Crossbone{03}Isle could be found in the{03}middle of the Karagol Sea.{02}{00}
Ah... Crossbone Isle... Wait,{03}did you say "could"? Is it not{03}there anymore or something?{02}{00}
Well, it's still there, but there's{03}no point in going. Someone{03}named {11}{01} picked it clean.{02}{00}
What, he took all the treasure?{02}{00}
Yeah. And apparently, he{03}even defeated the ancient{03}ghost pirate protecting it...{02}{00}
What about the stories that if you{03}beat the ghost pirate, you would{03}become the leader of all pirates?{02}{00}
Well, you see, that means that{03}{11}{01} is our leader now.{02}{00}
Wow... just like that?{05} I'll bet{03}he's pretty tough.{02}{00}
No doubt. But you know, he{03}must be a reliable guy, too...{02}{00}
You think?{02}{00}
You'd have to be to beat that{03}ghost. That's why we're looking{03}for him now, remember?{02}{00}
If he's looking for a pirate{03}crew, he can count me in!{02}{00}
Hey! Wait a minute!{02}{00}
Who are you?{02}{00}
You were talking about{03}{11}{01}, weren't you?{02}{00}
Don't play dumb...{03}We all heard you.{02}{00}
Yes, we know {11}{01}.{03}What about him?{02}{00}
Well, why don't you tell us{03}where we can find him?{02}{00}
Why should we tell{03}you anything?{02}{00}
{11}{01} took good care of{03}us when we were in Vault, and{03}we'd like to thank him...{02}{00}
Ah, yes... Well... I'm afraid{03}we don't know where you can{03}find {11}{01} right now.{02}{00}
Oh, is that so? Well, I guess{03}we'll just have to give you the{03}reward we'd planned for him.{02}{00}
You've got a grudge against{03}{11}{01}, and you're going{03}to take it out on us?{02}{00}
Oh yeah, you could call it{03}a grudge... A serious grudge.{02}{00}
But don't worry... We're just{03}going to give you a little sample{03}of what we've planned for him.{02}{00}
It looks like {11}{01} runs{03}with a pretty feeble crowd...{02}{00}
Well, we have been working out.{03}Maybe {11}{01} won't be so{03}tough this time around...{02}{00}
So you think we just{03}got a lot stronger?{02}{00}
You let {11}{01} know{03}we're looking for him!{02}{00}
The band of thieves he busted{03}in Vault are coming to repay{03}the favor!{02}{00}
And we're not messing around!{02}{00}
Be sure you tell him!{03}And send him this way!{02}{00}
We lost again...{02}{00}
So, boss... You, uh... You think{03}maybe it was a mistake going{03}after these guys?{02}{00}
This means we're going to{03}jail again, doesn't it?{02}{00}
Aw... Why do we have to go{03}back to jail. I hate it there...{02}{00}
It's not like we really hurt{03}anyone... After all, we lost!{02}{00}
Yeah... And it's not like we{03}stole anything...this time...{02}{00}
We're not gonna have to{03}go to jail, are we?{02}{00}
You're thieves!{02}{00}
If we asked around, we could{03}probably find a dozen reasons{03}to have you locked up!{02}{00}
Are you guys, like, wandering{03}sheriffs or something?{1E}{00}
Because we could be really{03}useful to you if you are. We know{03}all sorts of criminal elements...{02}{00}
And even if you're not, we{03}could be really useful to you...{03}Anything's better than jail!{02}{00}
You can't honestly believe{03}we would let you join us!{02}{00}
Hey, come on! We haven't done{03}anything wrong, really! Not yet,{03}anyway...{02}{00}
Yeah! We didn't have enough{03}time to do anything bad before{03}we ran into you guys!{02}{00}
Yeah, so give us a break!{02}{00}
So, uh... Bye! See you later!{02}{00}
Will you promise to stop{03}following {11}{01} and trying{03}to get revenge on him?{02}{00}
The four elements are{03}the basic building{03}blocks of all matter.{01}The elemental spirits{03}are called Djinn.{01}The four elements are{03}Venus for Earth,{03}Mercury for Water,{01}Mars for Fire, and{03}Jupiter for Wind.{01}Each element has many{03}different Djinn.{00}
When you set a Djinni, its{03}elemental power may{03}change your class{01}or Psynergy. In battle,{03}you can unleash the{03}powers of set Djinn.{00}
When a Djinni is standing{03}by, you can use it{03}to summon in battle.{01}To use a summon{03}immediately, put your{03}Djinn on standby before{01}battle. But be careful,{03}because changing set{03}Djinn to standby changes{01}your class and Psynergy.{00}
If you have a standby{03}Djinni in battle, you{03}can use it to summon.{01}After summoning, the{03}Djinni will be in{03}recovery until it has{01}recovered all its{03}power. Recovering Djinni{03}cannot be unleashed{01}or used to summon.{00}
If a Djinni's power is{03}used to summon, the{03}Djinni enters recovery.{01}After it has recovered{03}its power, it will set{03}itself once again.{00}
When a Djinni is set to{03}an Adept, its power{03}may change the Adept's{01}class. Find your own{03}unique combinations of{03}Djinni to improve your{01}characters' classes.{00}
Psynergy is a mental{03}power. People who wield{03}it are called Adepts.{01}Psynergy can change{03}with class changes or{03}when you go up a level.{01}Try changing your{03}class to earn new{03}Psynergy.{00}
To give your Djinni to{03}someone else, move it{03}like this.{02}{00}
After choosing who gets the{03}Djinni, you can "set" it.{02}{00}
When your class changes,{03}the Psynergy you can use{03}may also change.{02}{00}
Setting a Djinni changes your{03}attributes and sometimes{03}even your class.{02}{00}
Each Djinni has different,{03}unique powers.{1E}{00}
Once we have been set, you{03}can unleash us in battle to{03}use our powers.{1E}{00}
So, {10}, let me demonstrate{03}the power of my attack now.{1E}{00}
See! What did I tell you? When{03}you unleashed me, I used my{03}special attack ability!{02}{00}
After being unleashed, we{03}Djinn will then stand by, ready{03}to be summoned back again...{1E}{00}
If you have multiple standby{03}Djinn, you can summon even{03}greater powers into battle!{1E}{00}
Choose this command when{03}you want to unleash me in{03}battle, all right?{1E}{00}
Then you can summon{03}even greater powers!{1E}{00}
After a Djinni has been{03}used to summon, it must{03}spend time in recovery.{02}{00}
And once we've recovered,{03}we automatically set ourselves{03}again, so we're ready to attack!{02}{00}
That's all you have to do{03}to unleash a set Djinni!{02}{00}
Hey!{02}{00}
You look like you already{03}know a little about us, huh?{1E}{00}
Well, you weren't very surprised{03}when you saw me. Am I right?{1E}{00}
No way! You? Surprised?{03}Nah, I can't believe that!{01}I mean, look at you! You're{03}an Adept!{02}{00}
I thought so. I could tell{03}you were an Adept from{03}a mile away!{02}{00}
See, you know all about us,{03}so you must be an Adept.{02}{00}
Even I know that!{02}{00}
You look like you're new around{03}here. Embarking on a dangerous{03}journey in a strange land?{02}{00}
I thought so... Well, I'm looking{03}for my companions... We were{03}parted when Mt. Aleph erupted.{02}{00}
Would you mind helping{03}me find my companions?{02}{00}
Come on, take me with{03}you. I'll even lend you and{03}your allies my powers!{02}{00}
You see, the more Djinn you{03}have with you, the more powerful{03}your Psynergy becomes!{02}{00}
All you have to do is set us{03}and then unleash us in battle!{02}{00}
If you gather a bunch of us,{03}you'll have all that power{03}at your disposal!{02}{00}
So what do you say? Will{03}you be a pal and take me{03}with you?{1E}{00}
Oh, come on! I promise I won't{03}be a burden and eat all your{03}chips or anything!{1E}{00}
But if I'm with you, you'll{03}be all kinds of strong!{1E}{00}
Wait, that's not it... There's{03}more! Your allies will develop{03}{09}{04}exciting new abilities{07}!{1E}{00}
And I'll be your best friend ever{03}in combat! I'll be all over the{03}bad guys, I promise!{1E}{00}
What, you want to see me{03}beg? Fine! I'm begging! PLEASE!{03}Let me join your group!{1E}{00}
You just don't get it, do you?{03}I'm not used to being ignored,{03}you know. Take me with you!{1E}{00}
Don't be a meanie, OK? Nobody{03}likes a meanie. I'm serious{03}here.{01}You don't really want to{03}leave me behind, do you?{1E}{00}
Oh, all right. If that's the way{03}you're gonna be, fine.{05}{05}{03}I'm coming with you anyway!{02}{00}
I'm so happy! Oh, you won't{03}regret this, I promise!{02}{00}
The Venus Djinni {08}{05}{15}{08}{10}{03}has become {10}'s pal.{02}{00}
While I'm here, would you like{03}me to give you a quick{03}explanation about Djinn?{1E}{00}
After bringing a Djinni{03}into your party, you must{03}set it to somebody.{02}{00}
Next, I'll show you how you{03}can use us in battle.{02}{00}
See! We Djinn can be{03}pretty useful, can't we?{02}{00}
But...there's one more thing.{02}{00}
So, we go from set{03}to standby to recovery,{03}then back to set.{02}{00}
That's just a simple little{03}explanation of how to use us.{02}{00}
Did you get all that?{1E}{00}
Hmmmm...{05} Do you want me to{03}explain it all to you again?{1E}{00}
Well, then, I guess I'll go back{03}to the beginning, OK?{02}{00}
Well, that's it. Now, we're{03}pals forever!{02}{00}
Oh, yeah! If you want to{03}learn more about Djinn,{03}refer to the help, OK?{02}{00}
You and your friends should{03}make sure you get the most{03}out of us Djinn.{02}{00}
To give your Djinni to{03}someone else, move it{03}like this.{02}{00}
After choosing who gets the{03}Djinni, you can "set" it.{02}{00}
When your class changes,{03}the Psynergy you can use{03}may also change.{02}{00}

Hey!{02}{00}
You look like you already{03}know a little about us, huh?{1E}{00}
Well, you didn't look surprised{03}when you saw me. Were you?{1E}{00}
No way! You? Surprised?{03}Nah, I can't believe that!{01}I mean, look at you! You're{03}an Adept!{02}{00}
I thought so. I could tell{03}you were an Adept from{03}a mile away!{02}{00}
See, you know all about us,{03}so you must be an Adept.{02}{00}

You and your friends should{03}make sure you get the most{03}out of us Djinn.{02}{00}
It looks like seawater has{03}seeped into the well.{01}I doubt anyone will be using{03}it for quite a while.{02}{00}
There's a passageway at{03}the bottom of the well!{01}I wonder if anyone else{03}knows about this...{02}{00}
It's completely full of water.{03}The bottom is really deep.{02}{00}
Meh? I saw the silhouette{03}of a man in the well!{02}{00}
It looks like this well doesn't{03}get a lot of use.{01}I guess it's because it's so far{03}from the main part of town.{02}{00}
There's only a little bit of water{03}down at the bottom of the well.{01}As hot as it gets around here,{03}I bet the water evaporates fast.{02}{00}
This well looks really old.{01}I'll bet this is exactly how it{03}looked back in ancient times.{02}{00}
There are some potatoes{03}boiling in the pot.{01}Maybe they're making{03}potato salad.{02}{00}
They're making nan.{01}It looks weird, though...{03}I guess in Madra, they add{03}nuts and raisins.{02}{00}
All the spices are neatly{03}arranged.{01}No dining table in Madra would{03}be complete without them.{02}{00}
There's a chicken curry slowly{03}simmering on the stove.{01}Judging from the smell and{03}the deep red color, it must{03}have a lot of tomatoes in it.{02}{00}
A pot of Masala tea is{03}boiling on the stove.{01}It's full of milk, and it{03}has a nice, sweet smell.{03}It's driving me crazy!{02}{00}
They're making tandoori chicken.{01}In Madra, it's cooked on the{03}bone. It's one of the dishes{03}they're famous for.{02}{00}
It's a roast chicken so big{03}that it's practically bursting{03}out of the oven!{01}Hmm... I wonder if it was{03}related to the chicken I saw{03}outside... I thought it was a pet!{02}{00}
Fresh eggs, over easy...{03}Some people call 'em{03}"sunny side up"!{01}When it comes to breakfast,{03}these are the best!{02}{00}
That cheese looks fabulous.{01}I could really use a snack...{03}Maybe with some bread and{B0}{03}Gah! I'm getting hungry!{02}{00}
Eeeeew!{03}They're frying up bug larvae!!{01}It looks awful!{03}But it smells GREAT!{02}{00}
It's lamb on the bone, broiled{03}over an open flame. The lamb is{03}golden brown and juicy.{01}They'd probably notice if{03}I took some... Too bad.{02}{00}
Huh, what is that!?{03}Lobster grilled in the shell!{01}I'd like to experience this{03}luxurious culinary treat{03}at least once in my life!{02}{00}
Newts skewered over an{03}open flame.{01}Are they making food or some{03}strange kind of medicine?{02}{00}
There are lots of strange-{03}looking plants boiling in that{03}large pot.{01}It's got a familiar smell I just{03}can't quite put my finger on.{02}{00}
Seasonal veggies boiling{03}with some lamb meat.{01}The oyster seasoning is{03}really tempting my tummy.{02} {00}
There is a seafood pie baking{03}in the oven.{01}Its reputation for having a, er,{03}fragrant smell precedes it.{02}{00}
It looks like some kind{03}of seafood soup.{01}It smells like the ocean!{02}{00}
It's Alhafra's famous{03}broiled lobster!{01}It's bigger than I could ever{03}possibly have imagined!{02}{00}
That seafood stew has an{03}abundant variety of fish.{01}One bite of that, and I'd{03}be hooked!{02}{00}
The steel resting in the flames{03}is glowing bright red.{01}This must be where they{03}forge sharp items.{02}{00}
There's fish I've never seen{03}before gently simmering there.{01}I wonder what this foul soup{03}could possibly taste like...{03}I'm not sure I want to find out.{02}{00}
There's a bright-red soup{03}full of beans and tomatoes{03}simmering.{01}That spicy smell is really{03}something else, but it might{03}burn my mouth a bit.{02}{00}
Ah, the smell of fresh corn{03}bread cooking in the oven!{01}One whiff, and I'm drooling{03}like a bulldog!{02}{00}
Contigo's famous for these{03}cookies they make...{01}I've heard that, even if you{03}have the recipe, it still takes{03}years to learn to bake them.{02}{00}
It's roasted fish from{03}the nearby river.{01}The smoke is getting in my eyes.{02}{00}
That simmering soup is{03}made with broth of cow bones.{01}It seems it's a traditional{03}Shaman meal, passed down{03}from generation to generation.{02}{00}
I've never seen vegetables{03}like the ones boiling there.{01}Whoa! They really stink!{03}Do people actually eat those!?{02}{00}
There's Kaltic stew made with{03}lamb meat and potatoes.{01}Looks pretty tasty, if you{03}like boiled meat.{02}{00}
Those boiling vegetables{03}look like weeds.{01}I'm pretty sure I won't{03}be eating any of those{03}anytime soon.{02}{00}
There's cheese in this stew.{01}Hey! There's mold growing on it!{03}Is it supposed to be like that?{02}{00}
There is some strange{03}dish made using fish eggs.{01}There are strings coming from{03}them. I wonder if that's normal.{02}{00}
They've got some strange{03}meat I've never seen before.{01}Instead of using firewood,{03}they're cooking it with burning{03}antlers.{01}I wonder if the meat{03}and the antlers came{03}from the same animal.{02}{00}
It looks like there's a captain's{03}logbook in here.{01}There's something about an{03}unreported trip to Lemuria in{03}here... I guess they were rushed.{02}  {00}
There's a book called "The{03}Great Adventures of Lunpa."{03}...Written by Lunpa, no less.{01}"When the great flood came,{03}we fled our homes by boat.{03}Waves engulfed our ships.{01}"We came to in a strange{03}land called Lemuria."{02}{00}
I found a letter from Babi.{03}On the outside, it reads,{03}"To my dear friend Lunpa."{01}Babi wrote, "Forgive me,{03}Lunpa, but I must leave the{03}island without you."{02} {00}
Here's a book called{03}"The History of Lemuria."{01}An excerpt: "Only traces of{03}the once-brilliant land of{03}Lemuria remain today."{02}{00}

What's the matter, {11}{02}?{03}You're finally home again.{03}Aren't you happy?{02}{00}
{11}{02}'s just worried{03}about what's happened{03}to everyone in Vale.{02}{00}

I can't wait to see what{03}your hometown looks like.{02}{00}
It's beautiful... I'm sure you{03}will like it, {11}{08}.{02}{00}
I'm...just going to close my{03}eyes. Someone tell me if{03}it's all right to open them.{02}{00}
Me too... Would someone{03}else see how things are?{02}{00}
I'll go. Come with{03}me, {11}{05}.{02}{00}
How's it look, {11}{01}?{02}{00}
I'm almost there...{02}{00}
It... It can't be...{02}{00}
What is it, {11}{01}?{03}...{11}{05}? Say something!{02}{00}
I'm sorry, {11}{06}, but...{03}Vale...Mt. Aleph...{03}They're gone!{02}{00}
What!?{02}{00}
This... This is terrible.{02}{00}
Is that Mt. Aleph?{02}{00}
Mom...{02}{00}
Dora...{02}{00}
Mom... Dad...{02}{00}
{11}{01}... {11}{02}...{03}What can I do? What can{03}I say to comfort you?{02}{00}
They're here somewhere...{03}They have to be here...{02}{00}
What can we do? How{03}can we help them now?{02}{00}
I don't know... Call out to{03}them... Such a tragedy...{02}{00}
I'll call them...{02}{00}
{11}{01}...{03}{11}{02}...{02}{00}
I understand what you're{03}feeling. I've felt it, too.{02}{00}
But standing here won't{03}bring them back.{02}{00}
Let's go back to Vault. We{03}can rest there and think...{02}{00}
... ...{02}{00}
... ...{02}{00}
Your family's safe, {11}{05}.{03}You don't have anything to{03}worry about anymore...{02}{00}
But what am I supposed{03}to do? ...I'm all alone now.{02}{00}
Aw... Poor baby...{02}{00}
{11}{07}, what's gotten into{03}you? How could you say{03}that to {11}{02}?{02}{00}
Tee hee! I wonder...{02}{00}
{11}{07}, {11}{04}!? You think{03}this is funny!? I've lost{03}everyone! My whole family!{02}{00}
{11}{02}!{03}Don't be so sad!{02}{00}
???{02}{00}
I'd thought you might be a{03}little more confident after{03}all your adventures!{02}{00}
!{02}{00}
Ha ha! I got to see my{03}brother crying!{02}{00}
!!!{02}{00}
So, you made it back, {11}{02}...{03}I knew it would take more{03}than this to beat you, Son.{02}{00}
Welcome home, {11}{02}...{02}{00}
You look surprised to see{03}us, {11}{02}.{02}{00}
How did you survive?{02}{00}
