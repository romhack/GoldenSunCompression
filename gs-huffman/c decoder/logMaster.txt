#0C39 The four elements are{03}the basic building{03}blocks of all matter.{01}The elemental spirits{03}are called Djinn.{01}The four elements are{03}Venus for Earth,{03}Mercury for Water,{01}Mars for Fire, and{03}Jupiter for Wind.{01}Each element has many{03}Djinn.{00}
#0C3A When you set a Djinni, its{03}elemental power may{03}change your class{01}or Psynergy. In battle,{03}you can unleash the{03}powers of set Djinn.{00}
#0C3B When a Djinni is standing{03}by, you can use it{03}to summon in battle.{01}To use a summon{03}immediately, put your{03}Djinn on standby before{01}battle. But be careful,{03}because changing set{03}Djinn to standby changes{01}your class and Psynergy.{00}
#0C3C If you have a standby{03}Djinni in battle, you{03}can use it to summon.{01}After summoning, the{03}Djinni will be in{03}recovery until it has{01}recovered all its{03}power. Recovering Djinni{03}cannot be unleashed{01}or used to summon.{00}
#0C3D If a Djinni's power is{03}used to summon, the{03}Djinni enters recovery.{01}After it has recovered{03}its power, it will set{03}itself once again.{00}
#0C3E When a Djinni is set to{03}an Adept, its power{03}may change the Adept's{01}class. Find your own{03}unique combinations of{03}Djinni to improve your{01}characters' classes.{00}
#0C3F Psynergy is a mental{03}power. People who wield{03}it are called Adepts.{01}Psynergy can change{03}with class changes or{03}when you go up a level.{01}Try changing your{03}class to earn new{03}Psynergy.{00}
#0C40 To give your Djinni to{03}someone else, move it{03}like this.{02}{00}
#0C41 After choosing who will{03}take the Djinni, you{03}can set it.{02}{00}
#0C42 When your class changes,{03}the Psynergy you can use{03}may also change.{02}{00}
#0C43 Setting a Djinni changes{03}your attributes and{03}maybe even your class.{02}{00}
#0C44 Each Djinni has{03}different powers.{1E}{00}
#0C45 Once we are set, you{03}can unleash us to{03}use our powers.{1E}{00}
#0C46 So, let me demonstrate{03}the power of my attack,{03}{11}{01}.{1E}{00}
#0C47 See! When you unleashed{03}me, I attacked with my{03}mighty stone-cleaver!{02}{00}
#0C48 After being unleashed,{03}we Djinn will then{03}stand by to be summoned...{1E}{00}
#0C49 If you have standby{03}Djinn, you can summon{03}even greater powers!{1E}{00}
#0C4A Choose this command{03}to unleash me in{03}battle, OK?{1E}{00}
#0C4B Then you can summon{03}even greater powers!{1E}{00}
#0C4C After a Djinni has been{03}used to summon, it must{03}spend time in recovery.{02}{00}
#0C4D And after we recover, we{03}will set ourselves again{03}and be ready to attack.{02}{00}
#0C4E That's all you have to do{03}to unleash a set Djinni!{02}{00}
#0C4F Oh!{02}{00}
#0C50 A traveling warrior!{02}{00}
#0C51 And I see you're an{03}Adept, too!{02}{00}
#0C52 You are just the kind{03}of fighter that I've{03}been looking for.{02}{00}
#0C53 Won't you please take{03}me along with you?{02}{00}
#0C54 I am a Venus Djinni.{03}My name is {08}{05}{15}{08}{10}.{02}{00}
#0C55 I must find my comrades.{01}We were separated from{03}each other when the{03}volcano erupted.{02}{00}
#0C56 ...Maybe you can help{03}gather my friends{03}together as you travel.{02}{00}
#0C57 If you let me join you,{03}I'll prove to be very{03}beneficial to you Adepts!{02}{00}
#0C58 Your Psynergy will grow{03}stronger, and your Adept{03}skills will also improve.{02}{00}
#0C59 You can call on us in{03}battle or just use our{03}power to boost your own!{02}{00}

#0E0E Hey, buddy, wanna{03}try yer luck at the{03}dice?{01}It's {16} coin{19}{03}to play.{1E}{00}
#0E0F OK! Then take the{03}dice.{02}{00}
#0E10 No? Oh, well.{03}Who's next?{02}{00}
#0E11 Read the sign if ya{03}don't know the rules.{02}{00}
#0E12 Hey! Ya don't have{03}enough coins! Ya gotta{03}pay to play.{02}{00}
#0E13 Ya won {16} coin{19}!{03}Talk about lucky!{02}{00}
#0E14 Ya lost {16} coin{19}.{03}Better luck next time.{02}{00}
#0E15 Lucky Dice{01}Throw the dice on the{03}table and try to get{03}the same numbers.{01}Prizes are based on{03}the numbers rolled and{03}where each die lands.{01}The more numbers{03}that match, the more you{03}win.{02}{00}
#0E16 Lucky Dice{01}If two numbers match on{03}either the dice or{03}the table...{01}it's called a pair,{03}and you don't win or{03}lose anything.{01}Two pair doubles your{03}money. Triple matches{03}triple your money.{01}Four of a kind is{03}perfect, and you win{03}five times your bet.{01}Plus, if your dice come{03}up perfect on the{03}Perfect Bonus spot{01}on the table,{03}you win an even{03}bigger bonus!{02}{00}
#0E17 Ya won {16} coin{19}!{03}Talk about lucky!{02}{00}
#0E18 Ya lost {16} coin{19}.{03}Better luck next time.{02}{00}
#0E19 Is this yer first{03}time to play{03}Lucky Dice?{1E}{00}
#0E1A Once ya start playing,{03}ya won't want to stop.{01}There's no other game{03}in all the lands that's{03}this much fun.{02}{00}
#0E1B Lucky Dice is all the{03}rage in Tolbi. You can{03}play it year-round.{02}{00}
#0E1C Whoa! Getting triple{03}digits is real tough!{02}{00}
#0E1D I don't want to stop{03}playing Lucky Dice, but{03}I can't spend anymore!{02}{00}
#0E1E Winning or losing{03}is pure luck. I ain't{03}cheatin' nobody.{02}{00}
#0E1F The rules for Lucky Dice{03}ain't all that hard.{01}Ya can even learn{03}'em while ya play.{02}{00}
#0E20 Sometimes, people who{03}have never played{03}Lucky Dice win the most.{01}They call that{03}beginner's luck.{02}{00}
#0E21 Thinking won't help{03}you win this game.{03}When I try to think{01}about how to throw the{03}dice, I lose. Maybe{03}I think too much.{02}{00}
#0E22 My luck has run out{03}for today. I better{03}quit playing.{02}{00}
#0E23 Step right up{03}and try your hand at{03}lucky wheels!{02}{00}
#0E24 You gotta have game{03}tickets to play.{02}{00}
#0E25 You have {16}{03}game ticket{19},{03}{10}.{01}Would you like to{03}use these tickets?{1E}{00}
#0E26 The rules are listed{03}on the sign. Take a{03}look, take a look.{02}{00}
#0E27 You can't carry any more{03}items. Are you sure{03}you want to play?{1E}{00}
#0E28 If you win anything,{03}you might not be able{03}to take it with you.{01}Is that okay?{1E}{00}
#0E29 Then get rid of some{03}items and come{03}again.{02}{00}
#0E2A Step right up and enjoy{03}yourself.{02}{00}
#0E2B Choose how many{03}tickets you'll use.{02}{00}
#0E2C Are you ready to quit?{1E}{00}
#0E2D Now, we'll start{03}round {16}.{02}{00}
#0E2E Congratulations!{02}{00}
#0E2F You won {14}{02}!{03}Here you go.{02}{00}
#0E30 And you won{03}{14}{02}!{03}Here you go.{02}{00}
#0E31 Come again!{02}{00}
#0E32 Too bad...{03}Come back after you{03}get some tickets.{02}{00}
#0E33 Too bad...{01}Would you like to use{03}your tickets to{03}keep playing?{1E}{00}
#0E34 Lucky Wheels Rules{01}Pull the lever and{03}try to line up matching{03}icons to win big.{01}You have only 5 chances{03}to pull the lever.{01}Press the star to keep{03}a wheel from spinning{03}and match other wheels.{01}You get 1 line for{03}1 game ticket,{03}3 lines for 2 tickets,{01}5 lines for 3 tickets,{03}and 7 lines for 4 tickets.{01}Use all your{03}tickets on{03}Lucky Wheels!{02}{00}
#0E35 Lucky Wheels Prizes{01}Prizes are determined{03}by which icons you match.{01}Shirts win undershirts,{03}Rings win rings,{03}Boots win boots,{01}Stars and Hearts win{03}items, and Moons can win{03}you anything.{02}{00}
#0E36 Face away from Tolbi{03}Spring and toss a{03}coin into it.{01}If you get lucky,{03}something good will{03}happen.{02}{00}
#0E37 If you toss a Lucky{03}Medal and you get{03}really lucky,{01}you'll get a better{03}prize than you{03}would with a coin.{02}{00}
#0E38 Tolbi Spring has{03}mysterious powers.{01}Stand with your back to{03}the spring, and throw{03}a coin at the target!{02}{00}
#0E39 Do you have{03}a Lucky Medal?{1E}{00}
#0E3A Oh, you do?{03}How.{05}.{05}.lucky!{01}That means you'll be{03}extra lucky if you toss{03}it in the fountain!{02}{00}
#0E3B Hmm... If I were going{03}to try my luck, I'd want{03}to use a Lucky Medal.{02}{00}
#0E3C Too bad I only{03}have one Lucky Medal.{01}I don't want to risk losing{03}it if I miss, since it's{03}my only one...{02}{00}
#0E3D Hmm? Do you want{03}to test your luck{03}at Tolbi Spring?{1E}{00}
#0E3E Oh, you don't?{03}Well, I'm just going to{03}keep trying for a while.{02}{00}
#0E3F Really? Well then, I'll give{03}you the chance to go{03}first.{02}{00}
#0E40 Ah... I guess I just don't{03}have very much luck.{03}How about you?{02}{00}
#0E41 I keep losing coins,{03}but I just can't stop!{03}What's wrong with me?{02}{00}
#0E42 Would you like to{03}challenge Tolbi Spring?{1E}{00}
#0E43 What will you throw?{1E}{00}
#0E44 You don't have any coins!{02}{00}
#0E45 You have no Lucky Medals!{02}{00}
#0E46 You won{03}{16} coin{19}!{02}{00}
#0E47 You can't carry more items.{03}Do you still want to play?{1E}{00}
#0E48 {10} gave up!{02}{00}
#0E49 Coins{00}
#0E4A Lucky Medals{00}
#0E4B ={00}
#0E4C {1A}{01} Toss{00}
#0E4D {1A}{02} Quit{00}
#0E4E I get nervous when I toss{03}coins backward. I wish{03}I could face forward...{02}{00}
#0E4F Why won't anyone{03}give me a Lucky Medal?{02}{00}
#0E50 This is a Lucky Medal,{03}so it should be OK{03}if I miss by a bit.{01}I need all the{03}good luck I can get.{02}{00}
#0E51 Hmm... I wonder if{03}these kids will take{03}all the best items...{02}{00}
#0E52 {11}{01}, wake up!{02}{00}
#0E53 Please, dear, wake up!{02}{00}
#0E54 The Mt. Aleph Boulder{03}is going to fall!{02}{00}
#0E55 Come on, {11}{01}.{03}We have to go{18}now!{02}{00}
#0E56 {11}{01}! You forgot{03}something!{02}{00}
#0E57 It's pouring outside!{03}Don't go out without{03}your tunic!{02}{00}
#0E58 Have you got{03}everything you need?{1E}{00}
#0E59 I'm sorry, but we{03}don't have time... You'll{03}have to leave it behind.{02}{00}
#0E5A Good for you, {11}{01}.{03}A lost possession can be{03}replaced; a lost life can't.{02}{00}
#0E5B {11}{01}, Dora, hurry!{03}The Boulder could{03}fall at any second!{02}{00}
#0E5C Kyle... Will they be able{03}to stop the Boulder?{02}{00}
#0E5D I don't think so...{03}Not for long, anyway...{02}{00}
#0E5E You two go on ahead and{03}take refuge in the plaza.{02}{00}
#0E5F Aren't you coming?{02}{00}
#0E60 I need to help evacuate{03}the other villagers.{02}{00}
#0E61 Let me help you, Kyle!{02}{00}
#0E62 It's too dangerous, Dora.{03}Please, just take good{03}care of {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#0E63 {11}{01} is old enough to get{03}to the plaza on his own.{02}{00}
#0E64 You can find your{03}way, can't you,{03}{11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#0E65 You're a big boy{03}now, {11}{01}. Why don't you go{03}on your own?{1E}{00}
#0E66 You know the way{18}just{03}go south to get to{03}the plaza. Be careful!{02}{00}
#0E67 Huh? {11}{01}?{02}{00}
#0E68 Did you come to get me?{1E}{00}
#0E69 Oh... {05}Sorry to shove you{03}like that.{02}{00}
#0E6A This isn't the time for{03}games! Foolish boy!{02}{00}
#0E6B Well...{05}we'd better get{03}to the plaza before{03}the Boulder hits.{02}{00}
#0E6C {09}{04}Ugh... {05}Hrnghhh... {02}{00}
#0E6D {11}{01}, what do you want?{03}I'm trying to{03}save my things!{02}{00}
#0E6E What, you want me to{03}just dump my stuff?{00}
#0E6F I guess dragging a heavy{03}chest around like this{03}isn't very safe...{02}{00}
#0E70 You know, you're right.{03}OK!{05} Let's get out of{03}here!{02}{00}
#0E71 You're not just going to{03}leave me here, are you,{03}{11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#0E72 I guess dragging a heavy{03}chest like this around{03}isn't very safe...{02}{00}
#0E73 You know, you're right.{03}OK!{05} Let's get out of{03}here!{02}{00}
#0E74 Hey! {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#0E75 *Hah* {05}*Hah*{02}{00}
#0E76 Are you trapped, too?{1E}{00}
#0E77 Hmph!{05} It's not like you to{03}be caught unprepared,{03}{11}{01}.{02}{00}
#0E78 Oh, you got held up{03}seeing off the elders who{03}went to help the others!{02}{00}
#0E79 You came just in time...{03}We can go together.{02}{00}
#0E7A Everyone's gathering down{03}south, in the town plaza.{02}{00}
#0E7B We shouldn't go north...{03}that'll take us toward{03}Mt. Aleph.{02}{00}
#0E7C The plaza is over that{03}way. We need to head{03}south.{02}{00}
#0E7D We can't get around{03}this rock!{02}{00}
#0E7E We'll have to find{03}another way.{02}{00}
#0E7F {09}{04}Ahhh! The Boulder!{03}It's falling!{02}{00}
#0E80 {09}{04}Ugh...{05} Ughnn...{05}{05}{03}It's too heavy!{05}{03}We can't hold it for long!{02}{00}
#0E81 If our Psynergy runs out,{03}Vale will be destroyed!{02}{00}
#0E82 {09}{04}We have to hold on until{03}the villagers are safe!{02}{00}
#0E83 Hurry, boys!{05} Run!!!{03}It's just a little farther!{02}{00}
#0E84 Come on, {11}{01}, run!{03}The Boulder is coming!{02}{00}
#0E85 Rockslide...destroyed{03}fence... Monsters{03}everywhere...{02}{00}
#0E86 I'm{05} hurt pretty badly...{03}Do you think I'll die?{1E}{00}
#0E87 I knew it...{05}{03}This is it for me.{03}Save yourselves...{02}{00}
#0E88 This is awful.{03}I'm left here for{03}the monsters to...{02}{00}
#0E89 Wait... That's strange...{05}{03}I'm not hurt at all!{02}{00}
#0E8A But I'm serious about the{03}monsters, so be careful{03}on your way to the plaza!{02}{00}
#0E8B This is it for me.{03}Save yourselves...{02}{00}
#0E8C Oh no! My brother!{02}{00}
#0E8D Hang on, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
#0E8E {11}{05} will be all{03}right. We'll find a{03}way to save him...{02}{00}
#0E8F {09}{04}Nooooo!{05} {11}{05}!{02}{00}
#0E90 The rope won't reach...{03}We should use Psynergy.{03}Do you have any left?{02}{00}
#0E91 I've used all mine up.{03}What about you, Kyle?{02}{00}
#0E92 I'm drained from helping{03}the other villagers...{02}{00}
#0E93 We have to get help.{02}{00}
#0E94 Can {11}{05} hang on{03}long enough for us to{03}find help?{02}{00}
#0E95 There's nothing else{03}we can do for him{03}here,{05} is there?{02}{00}
#0E96 Then go get help, but be{03}as quick as possible!{02}{00}
#0E97 {11}{06}, can you go too?{02}{00}
#0E98 You'll go find help, right?{02}{00}
#0E99 Your brother's counting{03}on you, {11}{06}.{02}{00}
#0E9A All right,{03}let's get going!{02}{00}
#0E9B I'll go look up north...{03}You head for the plaza,{03}all right?{02}{00}
#0E9C Yes, ma'am. We're looking{03}for anyone with any{03}Psynergy left, right?{02}{00}
#0E9D {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#0E9E You saw what happened?{1E}{00}
#0E9F I have to go get help{03}before {11}{05} drowns!{02}{00}
#0EA0 I'm looking for someone{03}who can help {11}{05}.{03}He's fallen into the river.{02}{00}
#0EA1 I don't suppose...{05}{03}Could the two of{03}you help me?{1E}{00}
#0EA2 {11}{06} has gone to the{03}plaza to get help.{03}Go join her.{02}{00}
#0EA3 You don't have to if you{03}don't want to...{05} Just get{03}yourselves to the plaza.{02}{00}
#0EA4 Oh, {11}{01}...{02}{00}
#0EA5 You two don't have enough{03}Psynergy to save {11}{05}.{03}Go find help.{02}{00}
#0EA6 Hang on, {11}{05}!{03}Help is on the way!{02}{00}
#0EA7 Don't let go, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
#0EA8 Huh?{05} Are you...asking me{03}if I can use Psynergy,{03}{11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#0EA9 If I were ten years{03}younger, I'd have plenty{03}to offer, but I'm too old...{02}{00}
#0EAA I thought not... You have{03}to be young and strong{03}to use Psynergy...{02}{00}
#0EAB You expect an old woman{03}like me to use Psynergy?{01}Don't ask the impossible!{02}{00}
#0EAC {09}{04}Ohhh...{07} I'm exhausted.{01}I used up all my Psynergy{03}deflecting falling rocks...{02}{00}
#0EAD Oh!{05} Little {11}{05} has{03}fallen into the river?{01}That must be why {11}{06}{03}looked so upset.{02}{00}
#0EAE I have some Psynergy{03}left.{02}{00}
#0EAF See?{01}Isn't that impressive!?{02}{00}
#0EB0 {11}{06} went off that way!{02}{00}
#0EB1 Be sure to help {11}{05}.{02}{00}
#0EB2 Do you know what became{03}of the boulder that fell{03}from Mt. Aleph?{1E}{00}
#0EB3 What?{05} It's falling toward{03}the village? The elders{03}are holding it back?!?{01}They are the most{03}powerful Psynergy Adepts{03}in Vale.{02}{00}
#0EB4 They said the Boulder{03}would have to fall{03}sometime...{01}I just knew a storm like{03}this would knock it loose!{02}{00}
#0EB5 {11}{06} asked me to help{03}{11}{05}.{01}If I didn't have to use{03}Psynergy, I'd help in an{03}instant!{02}{00}
#0EB6 Go aid the elders! The{03}Boulder is too heavy for{03}them to hold much longer.{02}{00}
#0EB7 We can't let the Mt.{03}Aleph Boulder destroy{03}our village.{02}{00}
#0EB8 Let's go help the{03}elders.{02}{00}
#0EB9 We're counting on you.{02}{00}
#0EBA Grandpa! {11}{06}!{02}{00}
#0EBB {11}{02}, {11}{01}...{03}You came to help me?{02}{00}
#0EBC {11}{06} told me about{03}{11}{05}. Is that{03}why you're here?{1E}{00}
#0EBD Well, regardless,{05} I{03}want you two to help{03}{11}{06}.{02}{00}
#0EBE Good boys!{03}{11}{06} could{03}use a hand.{02}{00}
#0EBF Great!{05} I'm all charged up!{02}{00}
#0EC0 How are you?{05} Have you{03}recovered your Psynergy?{02}{00}
#0EC1 Enough to save {11}{05},{03}thanks to the Psynergy{03}Stone.{02}{00}
#0EC2 OK, {11}{06}, you heard{03}him. Now hurry back!{02}{00}
#0EC3 The path may be blocked{03}by fallen rocks. You two{03}can show them the way!{02}{00}
#0EC4 ...Thank you, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#0EC5 We're in a race against{03}time! You must hurry!{02}{00}
#0EC6 Mom! Dad!{05} We're back!{02}{00}
#0EC7 Is that you, {11}{06}?{02}{00}
#0EC8 Yes, ma'am...{02}{00}
#0EC9 I couldn't find anyone{03}who could help...{01}How did you do?{02}{00}
#0ECA You're just in time.{02}{00}
#0ECB Then my brother is{03}still...{02}{00}
#0ECC {11}{05} is all right.{05}{03}He's hanging in there.{02}{00}
#0ECD Come down here, so{03}we can save {11}{05}!{02}{00}
#0ECE No...{05} It can't be. Kyle...{03}It must be a dream...{02}{00}
#0ECF Mom, Dad...{05} {11}{05}...{05}{05}{03}Please...{05} Don't leave me{03}all alone...{02}{00}
#0ED0 {11}{01}... The Boulder...{05}{05}{03}We need to get help,{03}or everyone will drown...{02}{00}
#0ED1 {09}{04}Oh,{05} ohhh...{05} I...{03}I'll go!{02}{00}
#0ED2 {09}{04}It's no use.{05} I can't move...{05}{05}{03}{11}{01}, please get help!{02}{00}
#0ED3 {11}{01}...{02}{00}
#0ED4 I can't let him{03}go alone...{02}{00}
#0ED5 It's times like these{03}that we men have to{03}stand together!{02}{00}
#0ED6 Only the two of us{03}survived...{02}{00}
#0ED7 How could we have{03}anticipated Sol Sanctum{03}would unleash such fury?{02}{00}
#0ED8 It's a miracle that even{03}the two of us were{03}spared...{02}{00}
#0ED9 That switch...{05}{03}It must have{03}been a trap...{02}{00}
#0EDA But to think it could{03}conjure up a storm{03}this powerful!{02}{00}
#0EDB ...Another demonstration{03}of the awesome powers{03}of Alchemy.{02}{00}
#0EDC Regardless, we must not{03}fail the next time we{03}challenge Sol Sanctum.{02}{00}
#0EDD Next time,{05} we shall{03}certainly...{02}{00}
#0EDE {11}{01}! Wait!{02}{00}
#0EDF You were eavesdropping{03}on us just now...{03}weren't you?{1E}{00}
#0EE0 {11}{01}...{02}{00}
#0EE1 {11}{01}{05}, they look{03}scary...{01}Are you sure you should{03}be talking to them?{02}{00}
#0EE2 You must forget{03}everything you heard.{02}{00}
#0EE3 Don't worry...{03}We'll help you forget!{02}{00}
#0EE4 The door won't open.{01}The force of the impact{03}must have knocked it off{03}its hinges.{02}{00}
#0EE5 You think I should{03}forget these things and{03}save my own life?{02}{00}
#0EE6 Hmm... If a rock hits me{03}now, I'll lose both my{03}chest and my life.{02}{00}
#0EE7 You're right{18}I should{03}just ditch my stuff.{03}Let's get out of here.{02}{00}
#0EE8 Three years later...{02}{00}
#0EE9 {11}{01}! Haven't you{03}finished mending the roof{03}yet?{02}{00}
#0EEA You're almost done?{03}OK! Keep at it!{02}{00}
#0EEB Hyaa!{02}{00}
#0EEC Hee hee...{03}Still training, {11}{02}?{02}{00}
#0EED Hyaaaa!{02}{00}
#0EEE You sure do put your{03}heart into it, {11}{02}!{02}{00}
#0EEF Oh, I'm just finishing up.{02}{00}
#0EF0 That's good. It's time to{03}go, and I was about{03}to leave you behind.{02}{00}
#0EF1 Say,{05} what exactly{03}happened to you two?{02}{00}
#0EF2 The accident three years{03}ago...{05} Is that why you've{03}been studying Psynergy?{02}{00}
#0EF3 I appreciate your concern,{03}but...my family's never{03}coming back,{01}{05}and neither is {11}{01}{1B}{03}father...{02}{00}
#0EF4 I just want to forget{03}that day.{05} I wish{03}everyone would...{02}{00}
#0EF5 That awful day... We went{03}to get help, but they{03}found us unconscious...{1E}{00}
#0EF6 Well, let's get {11}{01}{03}and go to Kraden's...{1E}{00}
#0EF7 What, {11}{02}?{02}{00}
#0EF8 Huh?{05} You were about to{03}say something, weren't{03}you?{02}{00}
#0EF9 Don't be weird, {11}{02}!{02}{00}
#0EFA Whatever...{02}{00}
#0EFB {11}{06},{05} are you mad at me?{02}{00}
#0EFC I don't want to{03}talk about it.{02}{00}
#0EFD Come on!!!{02}{00}
#0EFE Huh?{02}{00}
#0EFF {11}{01}'s waiting for us.{02}{00}
#0F00 But, {11}{06}...!{02}{00}
#0F01 I'll leave you behind{03}if you're too slow.{02}{00}
#0F02 {11}{06}...{02}{00}
#0F03 Good job, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#0F04 You patched it nicely.{02}{00}
#0F05 All right. You're all done.{02}{00}
#0F06 You're very reliable,{03}{11}{01}...just like your{03}father was.{02}{00}
#0F07 What is it, {11}{01}? Do{03}you still think about{03}the accident?{1E}{00}
#0F08 I don't believe you...{02}{00}
#0F09 I thought so... {11}{01}...{02}{00}
#0F0A You and {11}{02} have been{03}working yourselves to the{03}bone studying Psynergy.{02}{00}
#0F0B Do you think things would{03}be any different if you'd{03}had stronger abilities?{1E}{00}
#0F0C That's what I thought.{02}{00}
#0F0D Hmmm...{05} I wonder...{02}{00}
#0F0E I was devastated when{03}Kyle died...{02}{00}
#0F0F I felt all alone...{02}{00}
#0F10 It's taken some time, but{05}{03}I'm better now.{02}{00}
#0F11 I still have you,{05} {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#0F12 You're almost seventeen.{03}You're so much like Kyle{03}was when he was young.{02}{00}
#0F13 I'm looking forward to{03}seeing where life takes{03}you.{02}{00}
#0F14 MA'{05}AAAAM!!!{02}{00}
#0F15 Hello, {11}{06}.{02}{00}
#0F16 Good morning.{02}{00}
#0F17 Yes, yes... Good morning.{02}{00}
#0F18 Well, if it isn't {11}{02},{03}too!{02}{00}
#0F19 Where do you all plan{03}to go today?{02}{00}
#0F1A We're going to Mt.{03}Aleph with Kraden.{02}{00}
#0F1B Mountain climbing{03}with Kraden, eh?{02}{00}
#0F1C Kids and their games...{02}{00}
#0F1D No!{05} It's part of our{03}studies...{02}{00}
#0F1E Ah, yes... Alchemy.{02}{00}
#0F1F Alchemy is the foundation{03}of all Psynergy...{02}{00}
#0F20 And you all know Mt.{03}Aleph is the greatest{03}source of Alchemy.{02}{00}
#0F21 They say Kraden is the{03}best teacher around.{02}{00}
#0F22 Alchemy... I wonder what{03}use it all is?{02}{00}
#0F23 Your mother would rather{03}see you grow up to be{03}a happy, ordinary man.{02}{00}
#0F24 But I suppose you{03}still want to go...{1E}{00}
#0F25 Well, if that won't{03}persuade you, I guess{03}nothing will!{02}{00}
#0F26 It's nice of you to humor{03}me, but I know you{03}don't mean it.{02}{00}
#0F27 You're just as stubborn{03}as your father!{02}{00}
#0F28 Ahhh!{01}{00}
#0F29 Be careful, ma'am!{00}
#0F2A {11}{02}, don't!{02}{00}
#0F2B Oh! That was exciting!{02}{00}
#0F2C I'm sorry I scared you{03}like that.{02}{00}
#0F2D Well!{02}{00}
#0F2E I...{05} I'm sorry, ma'am.{03}I'll get out of your way{03}right away!{02}{00}
#0F2F Wait! Not there!{02}{00}
#0F30 Huh?{05} What's wrong with{18}{02}{00}
#0F31 Oh, never mind...{02}{00}
#0F32 But you'd better{03}get going...{02}{00}
#0F33 This old house will fall{03}apart if you stay much{03}longer.{02}{00}
#0F34 I'll get this fixed up.{03}You don't have to{03}hang around here.{02}{00}
#0F35 Thank you, ma'am.{02}{00}
#0F36 Please, call me Dora.{02}{00}
#0F37 We'll get going{03}right away!{02}{00}
#0F38 Wait, {11}{02}...{05}{05}{03}Just{05} watch your step.{02}{00}
#0F39 Kraden is waiting for us.{03}We should go to his{03}house.{02}{00}
#0F3A Well, if it isn't {11}{01}.{03}It's just another quiet{03}day in Vale.{02}{00}
#0F3B Kraden had visitors{03}when I dropped by his{03}place this morning.{01}I wonder what became of{03}them...{02}{00}
#0F3C {10}! Have you{03}remembered to meditate{03}on Mt. Aleph daily?{1E}{00}
#0F3D That's very good of you!{03}Meditating helps keep the{03}peace in the village.{01}If everyone were like you,{03}things would have gone{03}better three years ago!{02}{00}
#0F3E For shame, {10}!{03}Mt. Aleph keeps{03}watch over Vale.{01}Meditate each and{03}every day to help{03}keep us safe.{02}{00}
#0F3F You had a very difficult{03}time three years ago,{03}didn't you?{1E}{00}
#0F40 You lost your father...{03}{11}{06} lost her whole{03}family...{05} It was awful.{01}At least {11}{06}{1B}{03}grandparents have been{03}able to care for her...{02}{00}
#0F41 You're a strong lad,{03}{11}{01}, so you were able{03}to deal with it all...{01}But I just couldn't bear{03}seeing {11}{06} like{03}that.{02}{00}
#0F42 The Valeans are a{03}chosen people.{01}Our powers of Psynergy{03}are proof of that.{02}{00}
#0F43 Long ago, my grandfather{03}was a powerful Adept...{03}I'm so proud of him.{02}{00}
#0F44 Did the travelers that{03}stopped by today go{03}to meet the mayor?{1E}{00}
#0F45 I told them where{03}Kraden lives, and they{03}didn't even thank me.{01}But I suppose they must{03}have some manners...{02}{00}
#0F46 It's very polite to{03}visit the mayor when{03}coming to a new town.{01}It's just shameful{03}not to do that.{02}{00}
#0F47 With Psynergy,{03}the more you practice,{03}the more you learn.{02}{00}
#0F48 Hey, {10}, have{03}I shown you my new{03}ability?{1E}{00}
#0F49 It takes hard work to{03}reach this level of{03}mastery, {10}.{02}{00}
#0F4A Really? Well, here's{03}a little sample for you!{02}{00}
#0F4B Behold, the power of{03}Psynergy!{05} Hahh!{05}{03}Impressive, isn't it?{02}{00}
#0F4C If your Psynergy runs{03}low, just walk around.{03}You'll recover it slowly.{02}{00}
#0F4D Rrruff! Rrrruff!{02}{00}
#0F4E Woof! Woof!{02}{00}
#0F4F There are some puppies{03}playing over there.{01}We should let them be.{02}{00}
#0F50 Those who can wield{03}Psynergy are called{03}Adepts.{01}Adepts are the servants{03}of good.{03}Never forget that!{02}{00}
#0F51 Our Psynergy was given{03}to us by the divine power{03}of Mt. Aleph.{01}It's because of Psynergy{03}that our wishes can{03}be granted.{02}{00}
#0F52 Psynergy should be used{03}to create peace...{05} It must{03}not be used for evil!{02}{00}
#0F53 Good weapons aren't just{03}sharp. They also draw out{03}the strength of the user.{01}...So said my father. Do{03}you know what he meant,{03}{10}? I do...{02}{00}
#0F54 Good armor isn't just{03}sturdy. It also draws out{03}the strength of the user.{01}...That's what they{03}say, but I don't know{03}what it means...{02}{00}
#0F55 A wise man knows to{03}flee from battle{03}when he's injured.{02}{00}
#0F56 My father also died in{03}that storm three years{03}ago.{01}I'm going to hone my{03}skills...{05} That way, I'll be{03}ready for anything.{02}{00}
#0F57 My son is still young,{03}so I don't make him{03}work too long.{01}But he takes after his{03}father, so I'm sure he'll{03}grow to be a fine man.{02}{00}
#0F58 Those three travelers{03}staying here may not{03}be thieves,{01}but there's something{03}strange about them.{02}{00}
#0F59 One of the men from that{03}group staying here wore{03}a mask over his face.{01}I guess he was trying{03}to cover up some scars{03}or something...{02}{00}
#0F5A Two of those three{03}guests staying with us{03}have gone out.{02}{00}
#0F5B Hey...{05} Boy...{02}{00}
#0F5C Do you have business{03}with me?{1E}{00}
#0F5D That's too bad, because{03}I have no business{03}with you. Be off!{02}{00}
#0F5E Then I suggest you stop{03}wasting my time.{02}{00}
#0F5F At the very least,{03}visitors should introduce{03}themselves to the mayor.{01}There seems to be an{03}appalling group in town{03}that won't even do that...{01}What's the world{03}coming to?{02}{00}
#0F60 I hear Kraden has guests{03}again. He's pretty{03}popular for a sage.{02}{00}
#0F61 {11}{02} has grown{03}quite strong in the{03}past three years.{01}Please watch over him.{02}{00}
#0F62 You and {11}{02} are older{03}now, and you can't waste{03}your time fooling around.{02}{00}
#0F63 {11}{02}, you make me{03}so mad sometimes!{02}{00}
#0F64 Your training stone{03}crushed my flowers!{02}{00}
#0F65 You're in for it tonight...{03}{05}Just {05}wait {05}and {05}see!{02}{00}
#0F66 I'll get you for my{03}flowers! {05}Just see{03}what happens.{05}.{05}.{05}tonight!{02}{00}
#0F67 You're in trouble now,{03}{11}{02}...{01}Your sister's really mad!{02}{00}
#0F68 I told that clumsy {11}{02}{03}it would be all right...{01}But what am I going to{03}do about this hole?{02}{00}
#0F69 It looks like it won't{03}rain for some time...{01}so I guess I'll just have{03}you fix it later, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#0F6A My granddaughter, {11}{06},{03}is finally happy again...{01}I have you and {11}{02}{03}to thank for that, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#0F6B I hope you two won't be{03}taking {11}{06} outside the{03}village with you.{02}{00}
#0F6C {11}{06} is the spitting{03}image of her mother,{03}whom we lost that day...{01}I just want {11}{06} to be{03}happy.{02}{00}
#0F6D So Kraden came to{03}Vale to study{03}Mt. Aleph, right?{1E}{00}
#0F6E He said he was studying{03}Mt. Aleph and Alchemy{03}and the like...{01}Mt. Aleph... Alchemy...{03}Are they related{03}somehow?{02}{00}
#0F6F But I thought...{03}Well, whatever.{01}If he furthers the{03}wisdom of the sages, it{03}will be quite a feat.{02}{00}
#0F70 If there are visitors{03}in town, we can't use{03}our Psynergy.{01}The ancient laws say the{03}secret of Psynergy can{03}never be revealed.{02}{00}
#0F71 Do you ever dream of{03}seeing the world outside{03}the village?{01}Someday, I'm definitely{03}gonna leave Vale!{02}{00}
#0F72 Few people outside of{03}Vale possess the power{03}of Psynergy.{01}That's why we need{03}permission to leave the{03}village...{01}{05}...To protect the secret{03}of Psynergy.{02}{00}
#0F73 I hear old man Kraden's{03}got some visitors.{01}{05}Let's go use our Psynergy{03}to scare 'em!{1E}{00}
#0F74 You're more of a{03}prankster than I thought,{03}{11}{01}. I like that.{02}{00}
#0F75 What? You're too serious,{03}{11}{01}...{01}{05}Only someone who has{03}Psynergy would figure{03}it out...{02}{00}
#0F76 Do you hear those awful{03}growls coming from the{03}other side of this fence?{00}
#0F77 You do, don't you?{03}{09}{04}I... I'm scared...{02}{00}
#0F78 Really? You mean I'm the{03}only one that hears them?{02}{00}
#0F79 This place looks just like{03}it did three years ago...{03}after the storm...{02}{00}
#0F7A {11}{01}, watch out!{03}Don't get too close to{03}the river!{02}{00}
#0F7B Since food is stored in{03}this hut, it isn't scary at{03}all{18}not even in winter.{01}If only things had been{03}different three years{03}ago...{02}{00}
#0F7C Do you need to go{03}past here?{1E}{00}
#0F7D You must be going to{03}Kraden's cottage...{02}{00}
#0F7E You mustn't go beyond{03}Kraden's cottage.{01}There are monsters{03}everywhere out there.{02}{00}
#0F7F Mt. Aleph looks{03}beautiful today.{03}It's so peaceful.{02}{00}
#0F80 Vale stays pristine{03}because of Mt. Aleph's{03}purity.{01}Taint that purity, and you{03}risk terrible{03}retribution.{02}{00}
#0F81 I'm jealous of you,{03}{11}{02}, because your{03}grandpa's the mayor.{01}Do you feel the same,{03}{11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#0F82 Yeah... When travelers{03}come, you get to hear all{03}about the outside world.{02}{00}
#0F83 Hmph... I can't believe{03}you're not jealous,{03}{11}{01}.{01}I sure wish I could{03}hear the stories of{03}travelers.{02}{00}
#0F84 Vale must remain hidden.{03}Psynergy's secrets mustn't{03}fall into the wrong hands.{01}It's one of the laws{03}of our village,{05} handed{03}down from long ago.{02}{00}
#0F85 They seem to know{03}little of Sol Sanctum's{03}mysteries.{02}{00}
#0F86 The elders of Vale must{03}not permit anyone to{03}enter it, not even Kraden.{02}{00}
#0F87 Kraden...{05}{03}Can we use him?{02}{00}
#0F88 Hmm...{05} His knowledge is{03}no meager thing.{03}...We can use him.{02}{00}
#0F89 But he's more stubborn{03}than we expected...{02}{00}
#0F8A And cunning, too...{03}Cunning beyond measure.{02}{00}
#0F8B If he won't go willingly,{03}then we can always...{02}{00}
#0F8C You there!{03}What are you doing?{02}{00}
#0F8D What are we doing?{02}{00}
#0F8E Were you eavesdropping{03}on our conversation?{1E}{00}
#0F8F Oh ho!{05} Well...{03}{05}I can't permit you{03}to continue your spying.{02}{00}
#0F90 Hmph!{05} I guess that I should{03}take you at your word...{02}{00}
#0F91 Hey, you're the ones who{03}were sneaking around!{02}{00}
#0F92 Sneaking...{05}{03}Who are you,{03}to accuse me!{02}{00}
#0F93 So Kraden's engagement{03}was with you...{02}{00}
#0F94 Yeah, we're off to{03}meet him right now.{02}{00}
#0F95 And this appointment is{03}important enough to{03}drive us away?{1E}{00}
#0F96 Pfeh! If your errand{03}is more important than{03}our own, then...{02}{00}
#0F97 Nevertheless, Kraden sent{03}us away. He awaits you.{02}{00}
#0F98 Go...{02}{00}
#0F99 You're letting us go?{02}{00}
#0F9A Are you sure, Saturos?{02}{00}
#0F9B Menardi, we have no{03}reason to delay these{03}children any further.{02}{00}
#0F9C Let's...{05} Let's go, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#0F9D Go, children. You mustn't{03}keep Kraden waiting.{02}{00}
#0F9E You'd better leave, before{03}we change our minds.{02}{00}
#0F9F Just who were they?{02}{00}
#0FA0 They already know{03}too much about{05}{03}Sol Sanctum...{02}{00}
#0FA1 ...things that even{03}the elders of Vale{03}don't know.{02}{00}
#0FA2 And what were they{03}saying about the{03}elements?{02}{00}
#0FA3 The elements of Alchemy:{03}earth, {05}water, {05}fire, {05}{03}and wind...{01}They plan to set{03}them into motion?{02}{00}
#0FA4 And the four Elemental{03}Stars are the key?{02}{00}
#0FA5 These are things even I,{05}{03}a trained Alchemy sage,{03}do not know.{02}{00}
#0FA6 Oh! {10}...{02}{00}
#0FA7 You look like something's{03}bothering you.{02}{00}
#0FA8 Me?{05} Ah, well...{02}{00}
#0FA9 It's those two, isn't it?{03}Saturos and Menardi{03}were their names, right?{02}{00}
#0FAA Are they still out there?{03}They're very persistent...{02}{00}
#0FAB Did they want something{03}from you, Kraden?{02}{00}
#0FAC That seems to be the{03}case...{02}{00}
#0FAD Seems to be?{02}{00}
#0FAE Mt. Aleph and{03}Sol Sanctum...{01}They spoke as if{03}they'd seen them with{03}their own eyes...{02}{00}
#0FAF Isn't that strange?{00}
#0FB0 Yes.{05} You can't enter{03}Mt. Aleph without{03}a very good reason.{02}{00}
#0FB1 Why, I had to wait many{03}years before I was{03}allowed into the sanctum.{01}Of course it's{03}strange.{02}{00}
#0FB2 And if they entered{03}secretly, then they might{03}be{05} thieves!{02}{00}
#0FB3 We have to go tell the{03}high elders and the{03}villagers!{02}{00}
#0FB4 Wait, everyone!{02}{00}
#0FB5 I still don't know how{03}accurate the things{03}they said were...{02}{00}
#0FB6 We can do nothing{03}until we confirm what{03}they told me.{02}{00}
#0FB7 Then what should we do?{02}{00}
#0FB8 Well, we go confirm it.{02}{00}
#0FB9 ...{05}Do you mean we{03}should go into Sol{03}Sanctum ourselves?{02}{00}
#0FBA Isn't that impossible?{02}{00}
#0FBB Why would it be?{02}{00}
#0FBC Just because{03}climbing Mt. Aleph{03}is forbidden?{1E}{00}
#0FBD We're just going to{03}see whether they've{03}been to the mountain.{01}{05}Surely, that would{03}be acceptable!{02}{00}
#0FBE That's right. {05}We're just{03}going to see if they've{03}been to Mt. Aleph.{02}{00}
#0FBF We'll be fine if they{03}don't see us, right?{1E}{00}
#0FC0 Right. We won't be doing{03}anything bad up there.{02}{00}
#0FC1 Sure, you say no, but{03}you know you want to!{02}{00}
#0FC2 This will just be{03}our{05} secret, OK?{1E}{00}
#0FC3 No, {11}{01}!{05}{03}You can't even{03}tell your mother!{02}{00}
#0FC4 Then it's decided!{02}{00}
#0FC5 We'll make you the leader,{03}OK, {10}?{1E}{00}
#0FC6 There are some dangerous{03}places between Mt.{03}Aleph and Sol Sanctum,{01}but you can handle it,{03}right, {10}?{02}{00}
#0FC7 You're more cautious than{03}{11}{02} is, {10},{03}so you'll be fine!{02}{00}
#0FC8 You don't have to be so{03}blunt...{02}{00}
#0FC9 There are some dangerous{03}places between Mt.{03}Aleph and Sol Sanctum,{01}so I'll take over if{03}you get nervous.{02}{00}
#0FCA If {11}{02} is our leader,{03}we'll be the ones who{03}are nervous.{01}Don't you agree, Kraden?{02}{00}
#0FCB You don't have{03}to be mean...{02}{00}
#0FCC This is our best bet.{02}{00}
#0FCD All right!{05} Let's go!{02}{00}
#0FCE You're not planning on{03}sneaking up to Mt. Aleph,{03}are you?{1E}{00}
#0FCF Mt. Aleph is a sacred{03}peak. No one can climb{03}it without permission.{02}{00}
#0FD0 Well, I'll overlook{03}it this time...{01}But I've got my eye{03}on you, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#0FD1 Mt. Aleph is a sacred{03}peak. It is forbidden{03}to climb it!{02}{00}
#0FD2 Beyond here the path is{03}overrun by monsters,{03}so proceed with caution.{02}{00}
#0FD3 This is the entrance to{03}Sol Sanctum. This is your{03}first time here, right?{1E}{00}
#0FD4 It's an important relic{03}of our past. Take{03}a good look at it.{02}{00}
#0FD5 I doubt that... Few ever{03}get the chance to see{03}this sanctum firsthand.{02}{00}
#0FD6 What's wrong, Kraden?{02}{00}
#0FD7 Hmm...{01}Those two said there was{03}a hidden passage leading{03}deeper into the sanctum.{02}{00}
#0FD8 I've come here many{03}times, and I've always{03}thought it looked...strange.{02}{00}
#0FD9 I had always imagined{03}Sol Sanctum would look{03}different, somehow.{02}{00}
#0FDA What do you mean?{02}{00}
#0FDB Sol Sanctum was built{03}in honor of the sun.{01}There ought to be{03}something here to{03}reflect that.{02}{00}
#0FDC I was always puzzled{03}why there wasn't.{02}{00}
#0FDD If there is a hidden{03}passage, then maybe it{03}leads to...{02}{00}
#0FDE Well!{05} Let's see if we{03}can find it!{02}{00}
#0FDF I think he's serious!{03}Should we help him,{03}{11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#0FE0 But it's too dangerous{03}for us to split up.{03}We should stay together.{02}{00}
#0FE1 You can't seriously want{03}to turn back after we've{03}come this far.{02}{00}
#0FE2 Let's help Kraden.{03}We should stick together,{03}after all.{02}{00}
#0FE3 This is it! We've found it!{02}{00}
#0FE4 Clearly, this is the mark{03}of the sun...the heart{03}of Sol Sanctum.{02}{00}
#0FE5 It's just as I'd imagined...{05}{03}which means those two{03}were telling the truth!{02}{00}
#0FE6 But if what they said was{03}true, then that means they{03}must have been...{02}{00}
#0FE7 They were thieves!{03}They came to rob the{03}sanctum!{02}{00}
#0FE8 Let's hurry back to the{03}village and tell everybody!{02}{00}
#0FE9 Kraden?{03}What's the matter?{02}{00}
#0FEA We're so close...{02}{00}
#0FEB Close? Close to what?{02}{00}
#0FEC We've come all the way to{03}the heart of Sol Sanctum.{01}To turn our backs on{03}it and leave...{02}{00}
#0FED There's something wrong{03}with that?{02}{00}
#0FEE Sol Sanctum holds the{03}origins of Alchemy.{03}It would be a waste to...{02}{00}
#0FEF What do you think? Shall{03}we go a little farther?{1E}{00}
#0FF0 Thank you!{02}{00}
#0FF1 Then you can all go{03}back to the village{03}without me.{02}{00}
#0FF2 If you put it that way, we{03}don't have much choice.{02}{00}
#0FF3 I'm with Kraden.{03}I want to look inside...{02}{00}
#0FF4 Really?{05} We'll just go{03}a little bit further!{02}{00}
#0FF5 Good! It's decided.{03}Let's move ahead!{02}{00}
#0FF6 Wh{05}-What is this room?{02}{00}
#0FF7 There's a moon in the{03}center... A picture of{03}Luna.{02}{00}
#0FF8 This must symbolize{03}night...{02}{00}
#0FF9 These rooms must be{03}connected somehow, don't{03}you think?{1E}{00}
#0FFA Luna and Sol.{05}.{05}.{05}{03}These rooms must hide{03}some secret.{01}What could it be?{02}{00}
#0FFB But a room for Luna and{03}one for Sol? It can't{03}be mere coincidence.{02}{00}
#0FFC What does it all mean?{03}{11}{01}, would you look{03}farther up the passage?{1E}{00}
#0FFD Let me know what{03}you find.{02}{00}
#0FFE Then just wait there.{02}{00}
#0FFF Just wait over there.{02}{00}
#1000 That way leads out{03}of the sanctum. It{03}should be in these rooms.{02}{00}
#1001 {09}{04}Wha{05}-What's...{03}What's happening?{02}{00}
#1002 {11}{01} must have{03}found something!{02}{00}
#1003 {11}{01}! Stop!!!{03}You're about to make{03}a big mistake!{02}{00}
#1004 Wait, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#1005 What's wrong, Kraden?{02}{00}
#1006 This is a most interesting{03}mechanism you've{03}found, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#1007 But{05} this is clearly...{03}some kind of trap.{02}{00}
#1008 This is...a trap?{02}{00}
#1009 Go look in the Luna room,{03}and you'll understand.{02}{00}
#100A You've done well. Finding{03}this means you're looking{03}in the right place.{02}{00}
#100B But if you just move one{03}statue, you'll be caught{03}in the sanctum's trap.{02}{00}
#100C But{05} why would anyone{03}put a trap here, anyway?{02}{00}
#100D I don't know who did it...{03}but they've hidden{03}something very important.{02}{00}
#100E Perhaps...{05}they've hidden{03}the key to Alchemy itself.{02}{00}
#100F Should I tell you more?{1E}{00}
#1010 Hmm... Honestly, I doubt{03}you could understand it{03}if I explained now.{02}{00}
#1011 Hmph.{05} Well, even if I told{03}you now, you probably{03}wouldn't understand.{02}{00}
#1012 We must try to find{03}a solution to this mystery.{02}{00}
#1013 Sheesh... Another mystery?{02}{00}
#1014 I'll keep checking the{03}Luna room. You continue{03}exploring the sanctum.{02}{00}
#1015 My intuition tells me...{02}{00}
#1016 that light must be the key{03}to this secret.{05}{03}...We should test it.{02}{00}
#1017 {11}{01}{05}, let's see if{03}we can't figure this{03}out ourselves.{02}{00}
#1018 {09}{04}Wha{05}-What's...{03}What's happening?{02}{00}
#1019 {11}{01}{05} must have{03}found something!{02}{00}
#101A You found it, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#101B Kraden!{02}{00}
#101C Excellent work, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#101D Where did that{03}hole come from?{02}{00}
#101E When {11}{01} moved those{03}statues, two beams of{03}light shot out from them,{01}and then this hole{03}appeared in the floor.{02}{00}
#101F And {11}{01} dropped{03}the statue into it{03}after that.{02}{00}
#1020 Hmm...{05} Good{03}work, everyone!{02}{00}
#1021 So the statue puzzle{03}was the trap...{02}{00}
#1022 and that other statue{03}was here to...{03}disarm the trap.{02}{00}
#1023 And now that you've{03}disarmed it, we{03}should be all right.{02}{00}
#1024 I'll observe from the Luna{03}room, where it's safe.{03}You handle the rest!{02}{00}
#1025 You found it, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#1026 Keep doing that until{03}the light bathes all the{03}remaining quarters.{02}{00}
#1027 Look, {11}{01}!{05} The picture of{03}Luna changed to Sol!{02}{00}
#1028 But other than that,{03}nothing looks different...{02}{00}
#1029 That's strange...{05}{03}They went to the trouble{03}of putting a trap here...{01}And this is all that{03}happens?{02}{00}
#102A Somewhere, something{03}else must have changed.{03}We must find it.{02}{00}
#102B Look!{05} The symbol on the{03}floor! It changed{03}from Sol to Luna!{02}{00}
#102C Surely...{05}there must be{03}something in this room.{02}{00}
#102D If we go this way, we'll{03}leave the sanctum.{02}{00}
#102E Ah ha! This has to be it.{02}{00}
#102F Let's go, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#1030 Wait for me, {11}{01}...{03}I'm on my way!{02}{00}
#1031 It's a relief{03}of a minotaur.{01}The right eye is sparkling,{03}but there's a hole where{03}the left eye should be.{02}{00}
#1032 {10} set the small{03}gem into the empty socket.{02}{00}
#1033 You hear the sound of{03}shifting stone.{02}{00}
#1034 It's the minotaur relief,{03}with both eyes sparkling{03}brightly.{02}{00}
#1035 Wielders of Psynergy{03}are called Adepts.{01}Adepts are messengers{03}of good...{03}Never forget that.{02}{00}
#1036 Our Psynergy was given{03}to us by the sacred{03}power of Mt. Aleph.{01}Psynergy is what grants{03}the wishes of the{03}chosen people.{02}{00}
#1037 Psynergy is a power that{03}should only be used for{03}good... Never for evil!{02}{00}
#1038 Something clicked!{02}{00}
#1039 It looks like we've{03}found the hidden passage.{01}Things will be more{03}dangerous from here on,{03}so watch your step.{02}{00}
#103A More statues...{05} Hmm...{05}{03}It doesn't look like we{03}can reach them from here.{02}{00}
#103B Perhaps Psynergy{03}is the key...{01}{10}{05}, try to use{03}your Psynergy!{02}{00}
#103C Wha{05}-Where are we?{02}{00}
#103D Is that.{05}.{05}.{05}the ocean?{02}{00}
#103E No, it couldn't be...{03}The ocean has waves.{02}{00}
#103F The ocean...{03}What's that?{02}{00}
#1040 The ocean is a thing{03}of endless water at{03}the end of the world.{02}{00}
#1041 You would not{03}understand... Someday, I'll{03}show it to you myself.{02}{00}
#1042 The Elemental Stars...{02}{00}
#1043 They really exist...{03}The Elemental Stars exist!{02}{00}
#1044 You taught us about{03}those... Elements are the{03}foundation of all matter.{02}{00}
#1045 Stones, wood, even us...{03}All things are made{03}from those four elements.{01}Did I get it right, {11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#1046 Exactly...{02}{00}
#1047 No, {10}...{03}{11}{02} is quite correct.{02}{00}
#1048 As I have told you many{03}times, the elements are{03}the source of all matter.{02}{00}
#1049 Earth, {05}water, {05}fire, {05}{03}and wind{05}{18}these are{03}the four elements.{02}{00}
#104A Legend holds that{03}the four Elemental{03}Stars contain{01}the purified essence{03}of each element.{02}{00}
#104B And now, those legendary{03}stones are before us!{02}{00}
#104C The Venus Star...{03}The elemental stone{03}of earth!{02}{00}
#104D Mercury Star, possessing{03}the power of water's{03}many forms!{02}{00}
#104E There is the Mars Star,{03}glowing red with the fire{03}contained within!{02}{00}
#104F And Jupiter Star, bound{03}with the wind's fury!!!{02}{00}
#1050 Kraden...{05} Why are you{03}getting so excited?{02}{00}
#1051 How can you be so{03}calm in the face of{03}such wonders!?{02}{00}
#1052 You're looking at the very{03}source of all Alchemy!{02}{00}
#1053 ...Haven't I told you{03}all this before?{1E}{00}
#1054 What? I must have{03}fallen asleep, then,{01}because I don't have{03}a clue what he's{03}talking about!{02}{00}
#1055 Then this must be a lot{03}for you to take in.{02}{00}
#1056 The Wisdom Stone...{03}the Stone of{03}Sages.{02}{00}
#1057 This stone dominates{03}everything...{01}It can transmute crude{03}matter into gold, even{03}thwart death itself!{02}{00}
#1058 You understand now,{03}don't you?{1E}{00}
#1059 The study of Alchemy{03}began with the search{03}for this very stone.{02}{00}
#105A You still do not{03}understand?{01}Alchemy exists{05} because{03}of the Elemental Stars.{02}{00}
#105B I don't really get how it{03}works, but{05}{05} they have{03}enormous power,{05} right?{02}{00}
#105C Beyond enormous...{03}With a single gem, one{03}could conquer the world!{02}{00}
#105D Now, perhaps, you begin{03}to understand.{02}{00}
#105E Don't scare us like that,{03}Kraden.{05} I totally thought{03}you were serious.{01}Heh...{03}Conquering the world...{02}{00}
#105F Who can say what{03}the truth is?{02}{00}
#1060 That's why I've been{03}searching for the{03}Elemental Stars.{01}I seek to learn{03}the truth about{03}these stones.{02}{00}
#1061 Now they lie before me...{02}{00}
#1062 {09}{04}Whoa...{07}{02}{00}
#1063 Be careful, Kraden!{03}It looks slippery.{02}{00}
#1064 But I must examine{03}the Elemental Stars...{02}{00}
#1065 Make the boys do it!{02}{00}
#1066 Oh, I couldn't ask{05}.{05}.{05}.{03}Would you mind?{02}{00}
#1067 He'd be glad to get{03}the stones for you,{03}right, {10}?{1E}{00}
#1068 Don't make me ask you again!{05}{03}Won't you please do it?{1E}{00}
#1069 Thank you!{02}{00}
#106A You'll need this,{03}{10}.{02}{00}
#106B {12}{01} got the{03}Mythril Bags.{02}{00}
#106C You can't carry any more.{03}Organize your items.{02}{00}
#106D You brought those from{03}your cottage, right,{03}Kraden?{02}{00}
#106E What are those bags?{02}{00}
#106F They're made of woven{03}threads of Mythril.{02}{00}
#1070 I prepared them for{03}just such an occasion.{02}{00}
#1071 Now, go fetch the{03}Elemental Stars and put{03}them in those bags.{02}{00}
#1072 There aren't any Elemental{03}Stars out there!{02}{00}
#1073 {11}{01} put the{03}Venus Star in a{03}Mythril Bag.{02}{00}
#1074 Good, good!{03}Now, go fetch the others!{02}{00}
#1075 {12}{01} put the{03}Venus Star in a{03}Mythril Bag.{02}{00}
#1076 {12}{01} put the{03}Mercury Star in a{03}Mythril Bag.{02}{00}
#1077 {12}{01} put the{03}Jupiter Star in a{03}Mythril Bag.{02}{00}
#1078 {12}{01} put the{03}Mars Star in a{03}Mythril Bag.{02}{00}
#1079 Now, put the Elemental{03}Stars in those bags and{03}bring them here.{02}{00}
#107A Be careful, both of you.{02}{00}
#107B Good, good.{03}Now go fetch the others!{02}{00}
#107C Kraden, you're as{03}giddy as a schoolgirl.{02}{00}
#107D It looks like they've{03}spotted us.{02}{00}
#107E I thought we'd be{03}safe until they'd gotten{03}all the Elemental Stars.{02}{00}
#107F You! You mean to steal{03}the Elemental Stars!{02}{00}
#1080 Master Kraden...{05} Are you{03}calling us thieves?{02}{00}
#1081 As I recall, aren't{03}you the one who stole{03}our information?{02}{00}
#1082 What will you do with{03}us once you've got{03}the Elemental Stars?{02}{00}
#1083 I'm sure they'll do{03}us in once they no{03}longer need us!{02}{00}
#1084 Relax...{03}You will not be hurt.{02}{00}
#1085 That was our{05}{03}agreement, was it not?{02}{00}
#1086 That all depends on how{03}well they cooperate.{02}{00}
#1087 They'll be safe, as long{03}as they hand over{03}the Elemental Stars.{02}{00}
#1088 Isn't that enough?{02}{00}
#1089 You heard us...{03}If you wish to save{03}your friends,{01}then give us the{03}Elemental Stars!{02}{00}
#108A Do you accept our terms?{1E}{00}
#108B No, {11}{01}! You{03}must not give them{03}the Elemental Stars!{02}{00}
#108C Very good, {11}{01}!{05}{03}You must not give them{03}the Elemental Stars!{02}{00}
#108D Why would you deny us?{03}Don't you want your{03}friends to be safe?{02}{00}
#108E What guarantee do we{03}have once we've given{03}you the Elemental Stars?{02}{00}
#108F Guarantee...{05}{03}Ah. I have one.{02}{00}
#1090 You will have to remove{03}your mask.{02}{00}
#1091 Th-{05}That means...{02}{00}
#1092 Ah, of course. A fine{03}idea... He will be{03}our guarantee.{02}{00}
#1093 Under the circumstances,{03}we have little choice.{01}{11}{05}! Remove your mask!{02}{00}
#1094 What?{05} What did he say,{03}{11}{01}?{02}{00}
#1095 He called that guy {11}{05}...{05}{03}That's what he said,{03}isn't it?{1E}{00}
#1096 You heard it too?{05}{03}{11}{05}?{05} It can't be...{02}{00}
#1097 But that's what I{03}heard. {05}{11}{05}?{03}It can't be...{02}{00}
#1098 That day...{05} The Boulder...{03}We saw him die,{03}didn't we?{1E}{00}
#1099 You remember it, too,{03}{11}{01}?{05}{01}Then...what kind of{03}guarantee are they{03}giving us?{02}{00}
#109A We searched for weeks,{03}but we still couldn't{03}find him.{02}{00}
#109B What's wrong, {11}{05}...{05}{03}Don't you want them{03}to feel safe?{02}{00}
#109C {11}{05}... Wasn't that the{03}name of your brother?{02}{00}
#109D But that accident...{05}{03}My brother, he...{02}{00}
#109E I'll do it.{02}{00}
#109F I'll{05}.{05}.{05}.take off my mask.{02}{00}
#10A0 {09}{04}I{05}-It's not possible...{07}{02}{00}
#10A1 Is he...{02}{00}
#10A2 I know I've caused you{03}much grief, {11}{06}.{02}{00}
#10A3 It was a miracle that{03}I survived that day...{02}{00}
#10A4 We are the ones{03}who saved him.{02}{00}
#10A5 We saw him floating{03}unconscious in the{03}river as we passed.{02}{00}
#10A6 I've been with them ever{03}since... I've experienced{03}a lot.{02}{00}
#10A7 But why?{02}{00}
#10A8 Why did you leave{03}me all alone...{02}{00}
#10A9 {11}{06}...{02}{00}
#10AA My own brother...{03}I thought you were dead!{02}{00}
#10AB Save this teary reunion{03}for later.{02}{00}
#10AC That's right.{05}{03}The Elemental Stars{03}come first.{02}{00}
#10AD Is this acceptable?{01}{11}{05} would never{03}allow us to harm you...{03}or his sister.{02}{00}
#10AE {11}{05} will be our{03}guarantee. Now, give us{03}the Elemental Stars!{02}{00}
#10AF We don't have any choice.{03}Should we give them{03}the Elemental Stars?{1E}{00}
#10B0 I guess I should take{03}the Elemental Stars{03}to them.{02}{00}
#10B1 {11}{01} handed over{03}the Elemental Stars.{02}{00}
#10B2 If you don't hand{03}them over, they won't{03}let {11}{06} go!{02}{00}
#10B3 {11}{02} took the{03}Elemental Stars.{02}{00}
#10B4 All right, I'll take{03}them.{02}{00}
#10B5 They won't let {11}{06}{03}go if we don't{03}hand them over!{02}{00}
#10B6 Will you permit me to{03}relieve you of those{03}Elemental Stars?{02}{00}
#10B7 Oh, Alex...{03}You're late!{02}{00}
#10B8 Alex is another of{03}our companions. Hand{03}the stones to him.{02}{00}
#10B9 Oh, great. After we did{03}all that work...{02}{00}
#10BA {11}{02} gave him{03}the Elemental Stars.{02}{00}
#10BB I'm afraid I must{03}apologize in advance...{02}{00}
#10BC For you will be bringing{03}us the remaining Elemental{03}Star, as well.{02}{00}
#10BD Wait a second!{02}{00}
#10BE You want us to grab the{03}other one for you, too?{02}{00}
#10BF Oh,{05} did you not{03}understand me?{02}{00}
#10C0 You said you'd set {11}{06}{03}free once we gave you{03}the Elemental Stars.{01}You promised...{02}{00}
#10C1 No, my friend...{03}We want you to bring us{03}ALL the Elemental Stars!{02}{00}
#10C2 Stop grumbling and bring{03}us the last Star!{1E}{00}
#10C3 You don't want anything{03}to happen to your{03}friends, do you?{1E}{00}
#10C4 Thank you for your{03}cooperation.{02}{00}
#10C5 We'll be waiting for{03}the rest.{02}{00}
#10C6 I doubt that's how you{03}really feel. I'll ask you{03}once again.{01}You don't want anything{03}to happen to your{03}friends, do you?{1E}{00}
#10C7 What are you doing?{03}Bring us the final gem!{02}{00}
#10C8 ...{02}{00}
#10C9 My brother is alive...{03}but...why didn't he tell me{03}sooner?{02}{00}
#10CA If you want to save them,{03}you'll bring us the{03}final Elemental Star.{02}{00}
#10CB I am sorry, everyone...{03}I am responsible for{03}all of this.{02}{00}
#10CC There is only one left.{03}You're almost done.{02}{00}
#10CD What's the matter?{05}{03}What happened?{02}{00}
#10CE No!{05}{05}{05} Not again!{02}{00}
#10CF The water's gone!{02}{00}
#10D0 Without the energy of{03}the Elemental Stars, the{03}chamber is collapsing!{02}{00}
#10D1 Is this the "terrible{03}retribution" the villagers{03}spoke of?{01}No, this must be more{03}of Alchemy's power!{02}{00}
#10D2 Whew!{05} It's over...{05}{05}{03}But what was it?{02}{00}
#10D3 What is that?!?{02}{00}
#10D4 No!{02}{00}
#10D5 That rock...{05} It's floating...{05}{05}{03}Do you know what{03}it is, {11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#10D6 Yeah, I know it's{03}a rock, stupid!{02}{00}
#10D7 Me neither. It looks{03}like someone is using{03}Psynergy to lift it...{02}{00}
#10D8 Could that be{05}.{05}.{05}.{03}the Wise One?!?{02}{00}
#10D9 Such power...{03}Incredible!{02}{00}
#10DA !!!{02}{00}
#10DB Wow...{02}{00}
#10DC It must be the guardian{03}of the Elemental Stars!{02}{00}
#10DD This doesn't look good...{05}{03}Maybe we should just{03}escape while we can.{02}{00}
#10DE But we need the Mars{03}Star. We can't leave{03}it behind!{02}{00}
#10DF I agree with {11}{05}.{03}We're no match for{03}the guardian.{02}{00}
#10E0 The Mars Star will have{03}to wait for another day.{02}{00}
#10E1 What about {11}{01} and{03}{11}{02}? You can't just{03}leave them here!{02}{00}
#10E2 Forget about them.{03}They won't make it{03}out alive.{02}{00}
#10E3 But, Saturos, there's still{03}a chance they might{03}survive.{02}{00}
#10E4 Anything is possible...{03}So what do you suggest{03}we do?{02}{00}
#10E5 We take this "{11}{06}" with{03}us... If they survive, they{03}will want her back.{01}And if they want her{03}back, they will bring us{03}the Star.{02}{00}
#10E6 Regardless, Kraden must{03}come with us.{05} He is{03}connected to all of this.{02}{00}
#10E7 Alex{05}... {03}Are you breaking{03}our promise?{02}{00}
#10E8 Conditions have changed{03}since we made that{03}promise.{02}{00}
#10E9 {11}{06}'s not any part of{03}this. I won't let you{03}hurt her!{02}{00}
#10EA Do what you will with me.{03}Just let {11}{06} go!{02}{00}
#10EB Your bravery speaks well{03}of you, old man, but you{03}cannot help {11}{06} now.{02}{00}
#10EC If we leave {11}{06}, she{03}will surely die. Is that{03}what you want, {11}{05}?{02}{00}
#10ED Perhaps we ought to{03}continue this elsewhere,{03}{11}{05}.{02}{00}
#10EE {11}{05}...{02}{00}
#10EF Please...can we go now?{02}{00}
#10F0 Let's make haste!{02}{00}
#10F1 Hey, don't push my sister!{02}{00}
#10F2 Who do you think you're{03}talking to?{05} You owe{03}us your life!{02}{00}
#10F3 Menardi!{02}{00}
#10F4 Master Kraden, you{03}will be joining us,{03}of course!{02}{00}
#10F5 {11}{01}{05}, {11}{02}!{05}{03}Don't{05}{05}{05} die!{02}{00}
#10F6 The Mars Star...{02}{00}
#10F7 It's a pity that we have{03}to leave it, but perhaps{03}we'll be seeing it soon...{02}{00}
#10F8 Well, this turned out{03}badly, wouldn't you say?{1E}{00}
#10F9 It's a miracle we{03}survived.{02}{00}
#10FA How can you be so calm{03}at a time like this?{02}{00}
#10FB {11}{06} and Kraden are gone!{02}{00}
#10FC You don't think they'll{03}hurt {11}{06} and{03}Kraden, do you?{1E}{00}
#10FD Thanks a lot...{03}But seriously, {11}{06} and{03}Kraden should be fine.{01}{11}{05} is with them...{02}{00}
#10FE Yeah{05}, they'll be safe.{03}{11}{05} is there...{02}{00}
#10FF This really is{03}terrible...{02}{00}
#1100 We've got a long way{03}to go if we're gonna{03}make it out of here.{02}{00}
#1101 We're{05} in big trouble...{1E}{00}
#1102 Let's get out of here...{02}{00}
#1103 Quit acting so tough!{03}Let's get out of here!{02}{00}
#1104 Hey, {11}{01}...{05}{03}{11}{01}, I'm over here.{05}{03}Come on, we've gotta go.{02}{00}
#1105 Why are you standing{03}there?{02}{00}
#1106 This place has{03}become dangerous...{02}{00}
#1107 You're the dangerous one!{02}{00}
#1108 The volcano will soon{03}erupt...{05} I cannot{03}hold it long.{02}{00}
#1109 You must leave this place.{02}{00}
#110A The Elemental Djinn...{05}{03}They have returned...{02}{00}
#110B Take out{05} the{03}Elemental Star...{1E}{00}
#110C {11}{01} cannot resist.{02}{00}
#110D Return it to its bag.{02}{00}
#110E The Elemental Stars are...{05}{05}{03}moving away from here...{02}{00}
#110F Without the power of{03}the Elemental Stars{03}to contain it,{01}the magma flows freely{03}once again, and this{03}chamber is collapsing.{02}{00}
#1110 There will be no chamber{03}for the Elemental Stars{03}to return to...{02}{00}
#1111 The world will be{03}exposed to the threat{03}of Alchemy.{02}{00}
#1112 Alchemy? A threat?{02}{00}
#1113 It can be a dangerous{03}power if it is{03}misused...{02}{00}
#1114 If the Elemental Stars{03}ignite the flames of{03}the four lighthouses,{01}that power will{03}be released.{02}{00}
#1115 As long as the four{03}lighthouses remain{03}unlit...{02}{00}
#1116 The volcano...{03}It's erupting...{03}Flee, now!{02}{00}
#1117 But how...{02}{00}
#1118 Ah.{05} I see.{03}I will help you...{02}{00}
#1119 Did that floating eye{05}{03}thing save us?{1E}{00}
#111A Yeah, right!{03}Let's get out of here...{02}{00}
#111B {10} got four{03}Mythril Bags.{02}{00}
#111C You have too many{03}items. Will you drop{03}something?{02}{00}
#111D It is very dangerous{03}to go beyond here{03}when Mt. Aleph is active!{01}Leave immediately!{02}{00}
#111E I am all alone in this{03}dangerous place.{01}How can the Great{03}Healer treat me like{03}this...?{02}{00}
#111F {10} checked the{03}Psynergy Stone.{02}{00}
#1120 It's {11}{02}'s chest{03}of valuables.{02}{00}
#1121 It's a huge rock that{03}{10}'s strength{03}can't even budge.{02}{00}
#1122 I thought Mt. Aleph{03}was{05} inactive...{02}{00}
#1123 Oooh, my grandson!{03}Will {11}{02} be safe{03}in this eruption?!?{02}{00}
#1124 Grandpa, we don't even{03}know if he's up there!{02}{00}
#1125 But, Sis,{05} someone saw{03}him and his friends{03}climbing Mt. Aleph.{02}{00}
#1126 They were hanging around{03}here while I was on{03}guard duty.{02}{00}
#1127 {11}{01} and {11}{02} went to{03}Mr. Kraden's house.{02}{00}
#1128 Didn't they{05} say they{03}were studying Alchemy?{02}{00}
#1129 Yes, they did...{05}but...{05}{03}what does that have{03}to do with the eruption?{02}{00}
#112A Uh-oh.{05} It's Grandpa{03}and the others.{02}{00}
#112B What should we do,{03}{11}{01}? Should we go{03}back up?{1E}{00}
#112C {11}{02}!{02}{00}
#112D {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#112E You're safe!{02}{00}
#112F Come over here,{03}both of you!{02}{00}
#1130 Where have you been?{02}{00}
#1131 What happened?{02}{00}
#1132 Weren't {11}{06} and{03}Kraden with you?{1E}{00}
#1133 They were taken away?{03}By whom?{02}{00}
#1134 What do you mean,{03}they were taken away?{02}{00}
#1135 This is all very{03}complicated.{02}{00}
#1136 We'll need you to tell{03}us exactly what happened{03}on the mountain.{02}{00}
#1137 Come into the sanctum,{03}both of you.{02}{00}
#1138 We had no idea...{03}The true sanctum...{02}{00}
#1139 And {11}{06} and Kraden...{03}They're prisoners?{1E}{00}
#113A They've been taken against{03}their will... How awful!{02}{00}
#113B Well...we can only hope{03}they're all right.{02}{00}
#113C Do you think they{03}can be saved?{1E}{00}
#113D {11}{06}'s brother, {11}{05},{03}will protect them,{03}won't he?{02}{00}
#113E Then our hopes must{03}lie with {11}{05}.{03}{02}{00}
#113F What is it, Great Healer?{03}You have been very quiet.{02}{00}
#1140 It's like you're a{03}thousand miles away.{02}{00}
#1141 That hovering stone,{03}the one that appeared{03}before {11}{01}...{02}{00}
#1142 What about it?{02}{00}
#1143 I have seen it before{05}{03}in my dreams.{02}{00}
#1144 In my mind's eye, it{03}appeared again just now{03}and spoke to me.{02}{00}
#1145 You saw it just now?{02}{00}
#1146 It must be the Wise One,{03}guardian of the Elemental{03}Stars.{02}{00}
#1147 It told me what happened{03}to you in Sol Sanctum.{02}{00}
#1148 So, what does the Wise{03}One say about the{03}eruption?{02}{00}
#1149 Will the volcano{03}destroy Vale?{02}{00}
#114A It is impossible to stop{03}the eruption now.{02}{00}
#114B Will Vale be...{02}{00}
#114C Vale will be safe.{03}The Wise One will prevent{03}the lava from reaching us.{02}{00}
#114D What's the matter,{03}Great Healer?{02}{00}
#114E ...The village will be{03}destroyed, won't it?{02}{00}
#114F Something even more{03}dreadful than Vale's{03}destruction looms ahead.{02}{00}
#1150 What could be worse than{03}the destruction of Vale?{02}{00}
#1151 A terrible power.{02}{00}
#1152 The Elemental Star gems{03}house incredible{03}power.{02}{00}
#1153 ...And Vale has been{03}guarding those gems?{02}{00}
#1154 The elemental lighthouses{03}will loose that power{03}upon the world.{02}{00}
#1155 Once the power of the{03}gems has been released,{03}the whole world will...{02}{00}
#1156 The Wise One wants{03}us to get the gems{03}back, doesn't he?{02}{00}
#1157 This world is ours,{03}to save or to destroy.{01}Our inaction may{03}bring about its{03}destruction.{02}{00}
#1158 What a pity...{02}{00}
#1159 We cannot hope for{03}salvation. We must save{03}ourselves...{02}{00}
#115A Then what can we do?{02}{00}
#115B Acquiring the Elemental{03}Stars is{05} their fate alone.{02}{00}
#115C Are you suggesting{03}we place the fate{03}of the world...{01}in the hands of{03}{11}{01} and {11}{02}?{02}{00}
#115D {11}{02} is only a child.{03}You can't expect him to{03}bear such a burden...{02}{00}
#115E The Wise One has spoken.{02}{00}
#115F Each of you shares{03}responsibility for this.{02}{00}
#1160 Now, each of you must{03}make your own decision!{02}{00}
#1161 I don't know what to do.{03}{11}{01}, you decide.{02}{00}
#1162 {11}{01}, will you accept{03}responsibility for the{03}fate of the land?{1E}{00}
#1163 I can't blame you...{03}I couldn't do it{03}if I were in your shoes.{02}{00}
#1164 Are you sure?{1E}{00}
#1165 Would you like to think{03}it over?{1E}{00}
#1166 {11}{01}, will you take{03}the fate of the world{03}in your hands?{1E}{00}
#1167 I don't blame you...{03}I couldn't do it if{03}I were in your shoes.{02}{00}
#1168 It is a terrible burden,{03}to be responsible for{03}the fate of the world.{02}{00}
#1169 Mother would never{03}doubt your courage{03}just because you declined.{02}{00}
#116A Was it right to refuse{03}when the world is in{03}such jeopardy?{02}{00}
#116B It's clear that the Great{03}Healer really wants you{03}to say yes.{02}{00}
#116C Once you step outside the{03}village, you cannot take{03}back your decision.{01}Think about that before{03}you leave the Sanctum,{03}{11}{01}.{02}{00}
#116D And so the world began{03}drifting toward its{03}fated destruction...{02}{00}
#116E From the Great Healer{02}{00}
#116F To the File Screen{02}{00}
#1170 Restart the game{02}{00}
#1171 You accept? Oh, {11}{01}...{03}{05}You can't mean it...{02}{00}
#1172 You chose to leave your{03}decision to {11}{01}.{01}There shall be no{03}further discussion.{02}{00}
#1173 O, Wise One, these two{03}have accepted your quest.{01}Give us your next{03}command!{02}{00}
#1174 You two are quite brave{03}to take on this quest.{02}{00}
#1175 I shall be watching you.{03}Choose your destiny{03}wisely, young ones.{02}{00}
#1176 That was the Wise One...{02}{00}
#1177 What did the{03}Wise One say?{02}{00}
#1178 {11}{05} must{05}{05} unlock{03}the power.{02}{00}
#1179 Find the lighthouses...{01}You'll have the{03}guidance of the Elemental{03}Star...{02}{00}
#117A Um...{05} Then what?{02}{00}
#117B What should they{03}do there?{02}{00}
#117C Surely, that cannot be all{03}the advice you can offer{03}them, Great Healer...{02}{00}
#117D Seek the elementals...{03}The Djinn...{02}{00}
#117E They will prove useful.{02}{00}
#117F Isn't there anything else?{02}{00}
#1180 That is all.{02}{00}
#1181 That's it!?{03}Isn't there anything{03}else you can tell them?{02}{00}
#1182 That is all, Mayor.{02}{00}
#1183 I leave it up to you, {03}{11}{01}...{05}{11}{02}.{02}{00}
#1184 H{05}-Hey, isn't it almost...{03}time to meditate?{02}{00}
#1185 Oh{05} yeah!{03}Meditation!{03}Let's go!{02}{00}
#1186 Well, what good are{03}those guys!?{01}Sending children off with{03}no help or direction...{02}{00}
#1187 I agree, but...{02}{00}
#1188 They didn't give us{03}any other choice.{02}{00}
#1189 Then,{05}{05} when should{03}they go?{02}{00}
#118A It doesn't sound like{03}we can afford to wait.{02}{00}
#118B Tomorrow, then?{02}{00}
#118C Tomorrow?{05}{05} Yes.{02}{00}
#118D Hey, you're {11}{01},{03}right?{01}The tremors on Mt. Aleph{03}have settled down a bit.{03}Thank goodness.{02}{00}
#118E If you don't know where{03}to go, why don't you try{03}Vault?{01}If you head east a little{03}and then head south,{03}you should find it.{02}{00}
#118F If you follow the road{03}east and then head north,{03}you'll hit the Goma Range.{02}{00}
#1190 The air is sparkling{03}because of the eruption{03}of Mt. Aleph.{01}Do you think the falling{03}powder is crushed{03}Psynergy Stones?{02}{00}
#1191 You saw the Wise One?{03}The same Wise One from{03}the healers' tales?{1E}{00}
#1192 That is a blessing...{05}{03}A blessing, indeed.{02}{00}
#1193 It was the Wise One who{03}saved the town when{03}Mt. Aleph erupted.{02}{00}
#1194 Long ago, Lunpa, the{03}righteous thief, founded{03}a town in the north.{02}{00}
#1195 {11}{01}, your mother,{03}Dora, has been crying{03}ever since you two left.{02}{00}
#1196 If your Psynergy runs{03}low, touch a Psynergy{03}Stone to replenish it.{01}Unfortunately, the{03}eruption blasted all the{03}Stones helter-skelter.{02}{00}
#1197 Aren't you worried about{03}crossing the land{03}with just the two of you?{1E}{00}
#1198 Aren't you worried about{03}crossing the land{03}with just three of you?{1E}{00}
#1199 Aren't you worried about{03}crossing the land{03}with just four of you?{1E}{00}
#119A Don't wander too deep{03}into unknown lands.{01}It's not brave to fight{03}against hopeless odds.{02}{00}
#119B There is a difference{03}between being courageous{03}and being reckless.{01}True courage requires{03}caution.{05} Sometimes, it{03}may seem cowardly.{02}{00}
#119C Replenish your Psynergy{03}before entering a{03}dungeon.{01}Sharp warriors know{03}to do that.{02}{00}
#119D My control over Psynergy{03}has grown since{03}yesterday evening...{01}It must be because{03}I met the Wise One.{02}{00}
#119E The power of Mt. Aleph{03}stems from the Psynergy{03}Stones.{01}If the eruption cast{03}the Psynergy Stones{03}across the land...{01}then perhaps new Adepts{03}will...{02}{00}
#119F Do you feel any change{03}in your Psynergy?{00}
#11A0 Oh, I wish the Wise{03}One would come to me{03}and give me power.{02}{00}
#11A1 The Great Healer said{03}my Psynergy powers grew{03}when I met the Wise One.{02}{00}
#11A2 Vale has felt so empty{03}and quiet since you{03}two left.{02}{00}
#11A3 Sniff! I...{05} I'm not{03}sad at all...{03}Go. {05}Just go!{02}{00}
#11A4 This is my farewell gift.{02}{00}
#11A5 {11}{01} took{03}the Herb.{02}{00}
#11A6 You must save {11}{06}!{05}{03}You must, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#11A7 Come back as a strong{03}warrior, {11}{01}.{01}By then, I'll surely be{03}a fine smith.{02}{00}
#11A8 I wanted {11}{06} to be{03}my daughter-in-law...{05}{01}Now she's gone.{03}This is terrible...{02}{00}
#11A9 Those visitors caused{03}the eruption and{03}kidnapped {11}{06}.{01}I knew there was{03}something strange about{03}them.{02}{00}
#11AA That masked man...{03}He was {11}{05}, right?{1E}{00}
#11AB It's hard to believe,{03}but...what if {11}{06}{03}was involved in all this?{02}{00}
#11AC What?{05} But didn't {11}{06}{03}see his face?{1E}{00}
#11AD If he is her brother,{03}maybe we shouldn't trust{03}{11}{06} too much.{02}{00}
#11AE What? But that's not{03}what you told the elders.{02}{00}
#11AF We're a small hotel, and{03}we get few guests...{01}But we still keep this{03}place clean, just in case!{02}{00}
#11B0 {11}{01}, please take care{03}of my grandson, {11}{02}.{02}{00}
#11B1 Receiving a quest directly{03}from the Wise One must{03}be quite an honor.{02}{00}
#11B2 I'm proud of you, {11}{02}.{03}My own son...on such{03}an important quest!{02}{00}
#11B3 As mothers{05}, Dora and I{03}will always worry about{03}you.{01}It doesn't matter how old{03}you get{18}you will always{03}be our babies.{02}{00}
#11B4 You guys are so lucky,{03}{11}{02}.{01}I wish I could{03}go with you.{02}{00}
#11B5 Please take care of my{03}brother{05}, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#11B6 Who are you?{05}{05} You can't{03}be... You're not{03}{11}{01}, are you? {1E}{00}
#11B7 {11}{01}...{03}That's a lie!{02}{00}
#11B8 He promised{05} not to{03}return until he fulfills{03}his mission.{01}My {11}{01} would{03}keep his promise.{05}{03}...Go away.{02}{00}
#11B9 I don't know who you are.{05}{03}I'm sorry{05}, but I don't{03}want to see anyone today.{02}{00}
#11BA I heard that {11}{06}{1B}{03}brother {11}{05} is alive...{01}But why is he caught up{03}with that bunch that{03}raided Sol Sanctum?{02}{00}
#11BB Please return my precious{03}granddaughter, {11}{06},{03}to me. {05}I will be waiting.{02}{00}
#11BC After {11}{06} was{03}taken, Grandmother{03}grew sick with despair...{02}{00}
#11BD It's because Kraden was{03}studying Alchemy...{01}That's why the{03}mountain erupted, isn't it?{02}{00}
#11BE They say the people who{03}caused this whole mess{03}had strange powers.{01}...{05}Is that true?{1E}{00}
#11BF If they were using{03}Psynergy...{01}That means there are{03}towns other than Vale{03}with Psynergy.{02}{00}
#11C0 If that's the case,{03}then I don't need to{03}worry.{01}It means Psynergy really{03}is a special power,{03}found only in Vale...{02}{00}
#11C1 I'm so jealous of you!{03}Being able to leave town...{03}Tch!{02}{00}
#11C2 Once you leave town, take{03}care not to use Psynergy{03}in front of others.{02}{00}
#11C3 I had no idea that such{03}a secret hid within{03}Sol Sanctum.{01}If only we'd known, we{03}could have stopped{03}this whole thing.{02}{00}
#11C4 Once I'm as old as you,{03}{11}{01}, I'm going to{03}climb that fence...{01}and journey to the lands{03}beyond!{02}{00}
#11C5 Sigh... No longer will I{03}see {11}{06} standing{03}there looking lonely.{02}{00}
#11C6 I don't blame {11}{05}.{01}If only we'd been{03}able to save him on{03}that fateful day.{02}{00}
#11C7 Look, {11}{01}.{05} That large{03}Psynergy Stone fell right{03}on top of the hut.{02}{00}
#11C8 It scares me that{03}something so big could{03}just fall out of the sky.{02}{00}
#11C9 I guess Kraden still{03}hasn't come back.{02}{00}
#11CA Vale is saved thanks{03}to the Wise One!{02}{00}
#11CB Ever since the tremors{03}started, Mt. Aleph has{03}been impossible to climb.{02}{00}
#11CC The ground still shakes{03}sometimes, but everyone{03}says the danger is gone.{02}{00}
#11CD The mayor was too kind{03}to those strangers...{01}None of this would have{03}happened if he'd kicked{03}those travelers out.{02}{00}
#11CE The eruptions subsided,{03}but it may erupt again.{03}I'm still worried.{02}{00}
#11CF Vault? Isn't that the{03}town with the{03}underground path?{02}{00}
#11D0 Once winter comes, the{03}lands beyond the Goma{03}Range get very cold.{01}I'm glad I don't have{03}to go there at this{03}time of year.{02}{00}
#11D1 If these sparkles truly{03}are all that remain of the{03}Psynergy Stones...{01}then Mt. Aleph must{03}indeed be in trouble.{01}I've heard the Psynergy{03}Stones are the source of{03}all of Mt. Aleph's power.{02}{00}
#11D2 I believed with all my{03}heart that the Wise One{03}really existed...{01}I'm so grateful that we{03}finally have some proof!{02}{00}
#11D3 Even the righteous thieves{03}seem to have changed{03}over the generations.{01}Nowadays, the thieves of{03}Lunpa are said to even{03}attack travelers.{02}{00}
#11D4 No matter how hard she{03}tries to hide her feelings,{01}{10}{1B} mother{03}must be lonely...{02}{00}
#11D5 You'll be very lucky if{03}you find any Psynergy{03}Stones in your travels.{02}{00}
#11D6 I'm worried about you,{03}{10}. You guys{03}are like brothers to me.{01}Promise me you won't do{03}anything foolish. And{03}come back alive!{02}{00}
#11D7 I wouldn't worry if{03}my Psynergy ran low in{03}a dungeon, because{01}I know that I can{03}recover Psynergy by just{03}walking around.{02}{00}
#11D8 The power of my{03}Psynergy has dramatically{03}increased, but I don't{01}know why. I'd really{03}like to try this Psynergy{03}out on something.{02}{00}
#11D9 The Angaran continent will{03}certainly see trouble from{03}these Psynergy Stones...{01}It makes leaving Vale{03}all the more dangerous.{02}{00}
#11DA My Psynergy...{05}hasn't{03}changed at all. It's{03}not fair.{02}{00}
#11DB {10}, you're going{03}on a difficult journey, so{03}be sure to do your best.{02}{00}
#11DC If you face any hardship{03}in your quest, do not{03}hesitate to come home.{02}{00}
#11DD So if that was {11}{05}{03}who kidnapped {11}{06}...{01}Then why do you have{03}to go save her?{02}{00}
#11DE I will think of {11}{06}{03}as I do my work...{01}We're all counting on{03}you, {10}!{02}{00}
#11DF Now that {11}{06} is{03}gone, we need another{03}girl to replace her.{02}{00}
#11E0 Who could have known{03}that masked man was{03}{11}{05}!?{01}I guess he hid his face{03}from us because{03}he was ashamed.{02}{00}
#11E1 I wonder if {11}{05}{03}changed much. He was{03}such a good boy...{01}Do you suppose {11}{06}{03}could change like that?{02}{00}
#11E2 {11}{05} and his gang{03}must have left in a hurry.{01}I found his wallet when{03}I was cleaning the room...{02}{00}
#11E3 It's hard letting my{03}precious {11}{02} go...{01}But no! I have to be{03}strong for everyone!{02}{00}
#11E4 The Wise One chose {11}{02}{03}himself, and I am so{03}proud of my boy.{02}{00}
#11E5 Once {11}{02} leaves,{03}I won't be able to{03}rest until he returns.{01}It's a good thing we{03}have two children.{02}{00}
#11E6 I am concerned for{03}{11}{02}, but he is my{03}son, so I am sure he will{01}be all right. I can't wait{03}until he returns to{03}Vale as a strong man.{02}{00}
#11E7 Gee, I wish I could{03}see new lands, too.{02}{00}
#11E8 My brother's strength is{03}his best asset, so he'll{03}be a big help to you!{02}{00}
#11E9 {11}{05} inherited his{03}father's skill with{03}Psynergy.{01}Open your eyes, {11}{05},{03}and use that Psynergy{03}for good, not evil.{02}{00}
#11EA {11}{06}, anytime you face{03}danger, just use your{03}Psynergy to overcome it.{01}The fire Psynergy you{03}inherited from your{03}mother will help you.{02}{00}
#11EB Why would {11}{05}{03}take his sister,{03}{11}{06}, away?{02}{00}
#11EC We almost lost the town{03}over something as silly{03}as the study of Alchemy.{02}{00}
#11ED I'd like to believe that{03}only the people of Vale{03}can use Psynergy.{02}{00}
#11EE If only I'd gone to Sol{03}Sanctum with {10}{03}and the others...{01}It should have been me{03}going on this quest.{02}{00}
#11EF Vale's laws state that you{03}cannot use Psynergy in{03}front of outsiders.{01}But you know that, don't{03}you, {10}?{02}{00}
#11F0 I wish I were the one{03}who solved the mystery{03}of Sol Sanctum.{02}{00}
#11F1 Why is it that no one{03}else is curious about what{03}lies beyond this fence?{02}{00}
#11F2 I'm glad that {11}{05}{03}is alive. I was so worried{03}about {11}{06}.{02}{00}
#11F3 {11}{05} was a good{03}person. I still believe{03}in him.{02}{00}
#11F4 Even if your Psynergy{03}runs low, you'll be fine as{03}long as you can find{01}Psynergy Stones. They{03}immediately replenish your{03}Psynergy.{02}{00}
#11F5 Poor Kraden was taken{03}to some faraway place.{01}I liked that{03}old coot...{02}{00}
#11F6 Vale was saved because{03}people like this old{03}woman worked hard...{01}to protect those who{03}couldn't protect{03}themselves.{02}{00}
#11F7 I can't believe anyone{03}would climb the mountain{03}after such an eruption!{02}{00}
#11F8 I just don't feel safe,{03}knowing Mt. Aleph could{03}still erupt!{02}{00}
#11F9 The people of Vale will{03}never trust travelers{03}again.{01}Of course, I never{03}trusted them in the{03}first place.{02}{00}
#11FA Why's everyone hanging{03}around the town gate?{02}{00}
#11FB What,{05} didn't you hear?{02}{00}
#11FC {11}{01} and {11}{02}{03}are leaving Vale on a{03}journey.{02}{00}
#11FD I wish I could go!{02}{00}
#11FE I heard it's going{03}to be really{03}dangerous!{02}{00}
#11FF Oh, yeah? So everyone's{03}down there to say{03}good-bye?{02}{00}
#1200 Hey, what's the matter?{02}{00}
#1201 Weird.{03}{11}{01}'s mother isn't{03}there to see him off!{02}{00}
#1202 You're right. She's not{03}there.{02}{00}
#1203 Hey,{05} should we go{03}say good-bye, too?{02}{00}
#1204 Sure! Let's go!{02}{00}
#1205 We are counting on you,{05}{05}{03}{11}{01}.{05} Oh, and you, too,{03}{11}{02}.{02}{00}
#1206 Don't drink the water{03}if it smells funny.{01}And...take this with{03}you, too.{02}{00}
#1207 I know not to drink{03}stagnant water, Sis!{02}{00}
#1208 Don't listen to him,{03}{11}{01}!{01}He's a pig!{03}He'll eat anything{03}that's not tied down!{02}{00}
#1209 Hmm...{05} Dora is very{03}late...{02}{00}
#120A Oh!{05} That's right!{02}{00}
#120B Aunty Dora asked me{05}{03}to give this to you,{03}{11}{01}.{02}{00}
#120C I guess we're all set{03}to go, huh, {11}{01}?{02}{00}
#120D Think again, {11}{02}!{02}{00}
#120E It must be very difficult{03}for Dora...{02}{00}
#120F As {11}{02}'s mother,{03}I know how Dora must{03}be feeling.{02}{00}
#1210 But I still have {11}{02}'s{03}father, while Dora has{03}only {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#1211 She doesn't want you{03}to go, {11}{01},{01}but she knows you have{03}to, and it hurts to{03}see you leave.{02}{00}
#1212 They can't keep standing{03}around here like this, or{03}they'll never leave.{02}{00}
#1213 So,{05} one final farewell!{02}{00}
#1214 {09}{02}Farewell!{07}{02}{00}
#1215 We can't stay another{03}minute in a dangerous{03}place like this.{01}We return to{03}Kalay immediately!{02}{00}
#1216 Master Hammet! This is{03}terrible! The bridge has{03}been destroyed...{01}We cannot continue{03}southward!{02}{00}
#1217 What...? The bridge?{02}{00}
#1218 This is awful...{03}How are we going to{03}get to Kalay now?{02}{00}
#1219 ...Master Hammet, I'm{03}worried about leaving{03}{11}{03} behind...{02}{00}
#121A As fond as I am of {11}{03},{05}{03}it is his fault my rod{03}was stolen...{02}{00}
#121B And his strange powers{03}will aid him in search{03}of the rod.{02}{00}
#121C {11}{03} has strange powers?{02}{00}
#121D We must leave this{03}treacherous place{03}immediately!{02}{00}
#121E But to where?{05}{05}{03}Where can we go?{02}{00}
#121F We have no choice.{03}We're heading north.{02}{00}
#1220 We'll wind up in Lunpa{03}if we go north...{02}{00}
#1221 Well, it's better than{03}being smashed by falling{03}rocks here, isn't it?{02}{00}
#1222 Welcome to Vault,{03}the town at the{03}heart of Angara.{02}{00}
#1223 Wasn't the eruption of{03}Mt. Aleph incredible?{1E}{00}
#1224 I was so stricken with{03}terror that I couldn't{03}sleep for days!{02}{00}
#1225 Aren't you courageous!{03}Not even an erupting{03}volcano scares you!{02}{00}
#1226 Master Hammet, a{03}wealthy landowner and{03}merchant from Kalay,{01}had his precious rod{03}stolen from him. He{03}was quite upset.{02}{00}
#1227 I guess some folks got{03}robbed during the chaos{03}of the volcanic eruption.{02}{00}
#1228 Master Hammet's servant{03}can't return to Kalay{03}until he recovers the rod.{02}{00}
#1229 Those travelers left{03}in a big hurry.{01}They looked like they{03}were on the run. Did you{03}see them coming in?{1E}{00}
#122A No, not Master Hammet...{03}It was a group of two{03}women and four men.{01}They were quite strange.{01}The young girl and the old{03}man didn't look too{03}happy to be there.{02}{00}
#122B Oh, maybe they left{03}earlier than I{03}thought.{02}{00}
#122C That poor guy, {11}{03}.{01}They left him at the{03}mayor's to look for the{03}stolen rod.{02}{00}
#122D Master Hammet's caravan{03}left town as soon as{03}the eruption stopped...{01}I guess that volcano{03}really shook him up!{02}{00}
#122E Nobody's stealing{03}anything on my watch!{01}We know the thieves must{03}be from out of town.{01}They must be!{03}No one living here{03}would break the law!{02}{00}
#122F Are you accusing us{03}of stealing Hammet's{03}treasured Shaman's Rod?{1E}{00}
#1230 Hey, just because we're{03}new in town doesn't mean{03}we're a bunch of thieves!{01}Besides, you can't{03}prove anything!{02}{00}
#1231 Ha! Sure! I knew you{03}were too smart to listen{03}to rumors.{01}But it wasn't us. Heck,{03}we don't even know{03}what was stolen!{02}{00}
#1232 Hmm, off on an adventure,{03}are you?{1E}{00}
#1233 It's impressive to see{03}youngsters like you going{03}on a dangerous journey.{02}{00}
#1234 Oh, well. Stop in and see{03}our Sanctum while{03}you're here.{02}{00}
#1235 Ruff! Rrruff!!{02}{00}
#1236 I suppose these{05} children{03}can't go anywhere since{03}Mt. Aleph erupted?{02}{00}
#1237 Mt. Aleph's eruption was{03}beyond description.{01}It was so frightening...{03}We're lucky we survived.{02}{00}
#1238 Why does a wealthy man{03}like Hammet make such a{03}fuss over losing one rod?{01}He has more than enough{03}money. He could just buy{03}a replacement.{02}{00}
#1239 No man should steal from{03}another during the{03}panic of an eruption.{01}It's unforgivable!{02}{00}
#123A Poor {11}{03}...{05} But the{03}rod may never turn up.{01}In that case, he can stay{03}here forever.{02}{00}
#123B That group of travelers{05}{03}was a strange bunch,{03}weren't they?{01}They seemed to be heading{03}to the northeastern parts{03}of the Goma Range...{02}{00}
#123C I bet it was those three{03}creeps at the inn{03}who stole the rod.{02}{00}
#123D I suppose it doesn't{03}matter how rich you{03}are...{01}if it can't save you from{03}an erupting volcano.{02}{00}
#123E Everyone knows those{03}three at the inn{03}stole the rod.{01}Tch! It's just so...{03}so frustrating!!!{02}{00}
#123F Hmph! It looks like{03}they're onto us.{01}We'd better leave town{03}as soon as possible.{02}{00}
#1240 I was just about to leave{03}this town behind me when{03}the volcano erupted.{02}{00}
#1241 Stealing in the midst of{03}a volcanic eruption...{01}Humans value money{03}more than they value{03}their own lives.{02}{00}
#1242 This rock was blown{03}here all the way{03}from the volcano!{01}It looks odd, doesn't it?{03}It sparkles so much,{03}it looks like a gem.{02}{00}
#1243 If only these rocks were{03}gems. We'd be wealthy!{02}{00}
#1244 The other sparkling{03}rocks all crumbled{03}to bits...{01}But this one I found{03}on the roof is perfect.{03}I must be lucky!{02}{00}
#1245 OK, mister...{03}Let me see that rock!{02}{00}
#1246 My neighbor creeps me{03}out. He always has that{03}smug smirk on his face.{02}{00}
#1247 Hey, mister!{03}Is it fun to see{03}strange new places?{1E}{00}
#1248 When I grow up, I wanna{03}be an adventurer and{03}sleep in a tent...{02}{00}
#1249 Oh... If it's not fun,{03}then why bother?{02}{00}
#124A Hey... Maybe my neighbor{03}is the thief... Yeah...{02}{00}
#124B I wonder{05} what the{03}outside world is like...{02}{00}
#124C Is it just me, or am{03}I missing something?{02}{00}
#124D Ever since the eruption,{03}Grandpa keeps wondering{03}if anything was stolen.{01}He doesn't realize{03}we don't even have{03}anything worth stealing!{02}{00}
#124E Could they be thieves?{03}This is no good!{01}I don't know who I{03}can trust anymore!{02}{00}
#124F You never bought me{03}anything worth stealing!{02}{00}
#1250 Could someone please{03}help {11}{03}?{02}{00}
#1251 My husband, the mayor,{03}can't believe anyone from{03}Vault could be the thief.{01}But unless we find who{03}stole the rod, {11}{03} can't{03}return home to Kalay.{02}{00}
#1252 I could help {11}{03} if{03}I were just a little{03}older.{02}{00}
#1253 {11}{03} has great powers.{03}Wouldn't you like to{03}know what they are?{1E}{00}
#1254 No way! It's our{03}secret!{02}{00}
#1255 Don't say it if you{03}don't mean it, 'cause {11}{03}{03}can tell in an instant.{02}{00}
#1256 Yes. I... I do{03}possess strange powers.{02}{00}
#1257 You have them, too,{03}don't you?{02}{00}
#1258 What? My power{05}... It's{03}called Psynergy?{03}I had no idea!{02}{00}
#1259 We have so much in{03}common... I feel I can{03}trust you with this.{02}{00}
#125A I am quite troubled{18}{03}Master Hammet's rod{03}was stolen.{02}{00}
#125B Would you please help{03}me get my master's{03}rod back?{1E}{00}
#125C I see. I suppose it's a{03}lot to ask of a total{03}stranger...{02}{00}
#125D Would you really?{03}Would you help me find{03}the rod?{1E}{00}
#125E I'm sorry. I shouldn't{03}impose on your kindness.{02}{00}
#125F Thank you. With your help,{03}I believe we can recover{03}the rod.{02}{00}
#1260 Your names are...{02}{00}
#1261 {11}{01} and {11}{02}.{03}I am {11}{03}. Pleased{03}to meet you.{02}{00}
#1262 My ability to read{03}people's minds frightens{03}you, doesn't it?{02}{00}
#1263 Am I really...{05}{03}Is my Mind Read so{03}frightening?{1E}{00}
#1264 {11}{03} and {11}{01}{03}clasped their hands{03}together.{02}{00}
#1265 {09}{04}Ahh! My mind...{03}Stop reading my{03}mind, {11}{03}!!!{02}{00}
#1266 So, {11}{01}...{03}Could you read {11}{02}'s{03}mind?{02}{00}
#1267 Just as I thought.{02}{00}
#1268 What? You read{03}my mind, too,{03}{11}{01}?{02}{00}
#1269 I guessed that I could{03}help you read minds if{03}we shared our Psynergy.{02}{00}
#126A Hey, that's not fair!{03}Why do you get{03}to read my mind?{02}{00}
#126B You're right... It's not{03}fair to read one-way.{02}{00}
#126C {11}{03} and {11}{02}{03}clasped their hands{03}together.{02}{00}
#126D Whoa! I did it!{03}I read your mind,{03}{11}{01}!{02}{00}
#126E Let's use Mind Read{03}to find the thieves!{02}{00}
#126F Wait a second...{03}Won't people know that{03}we're using Mind Read?{02}{00}
#1270 Oh, I see... You two can{03}tell when I am using{03}Psynergy?{02}{00}
#1271 {11}{01}, both you and{03}{11}{02} are Adepts...{01}Maybe that's why you{03}can tell when I'm{03}reading your minds.{02}{00}
#1272 Ordinary people can't{03}see anything. There's{03}nothing to worry about.{02}{00}
#1273 Don't worry...{03}I will not read your{03}minds again.{02}{00}
#1274 {11}{03} joined your{03}party!{02}{00}
#1275 Let me read the minds{03}of the townspeople to{03}find the rod.{02}{00}
#1276 Oh? You're going to{03}help {11}{03}?{02}{00}
#1277 Thank you.{02}{00}
#1278 Please look after {11}{03}.{02}{00}
#1279 Really? You're going to{03}help {11}{03} in his{03}search for the rod?{01}I'm so relieved{03}to hear that.{02}{00}
#127A You're helping {11}{03}?{01}You don't look very{03}reliable, but at least{03}he won't be alone.{02}{00}
#127B Since you're helping{03}{11}{03}, I'll tell you a{03}secret...{01}{11}{03} has the power{03}to talk with animals!{03}...Isn't that neat?{02}{00}
#127C Hey! That tickles...{03}Being tickled by a{03}boy isn't so fun.{02}{00}
#127D Maybe they'll find our{03}stolen family heirloom{03}while they're looking.{01}I miss that old urn.{02}{00}
#127E These guys look reliable{05},{03}I guess. {11}{03}'s pretty{03}lucky!{02}{00}
#127F I wonder what sort of{03}thing an animal would say.{03}I wish I had that power!{02}{00}
#1280 Master Hammet isn't the{03}only one who had{03}things stolen.{01}We lost a lot of{03}expensive goods.{02}{00}
#1281 All our best weapons{03}were stolen...{01}I'm sorry I've only{03}got these cheap weapons{03}to sell right now.{02}{00}
#1282 The thieves didn't hit our{03}house during the eruption,{03}but I'm still angry.{01}Once we find those{03}thieves, we're going{03}to make them pay.{02}{00}
#1283 I wonder if they left us{03}alone because we don't{03}carry any valuable armor?{02}{00}
#1284 Did you just arrive{03}in town today?{1E}{00}
#1285 Then I suppose you're{03}not the thieves.{02}{00}
#1286 Hmm...{05} Something's fishy...{05}{03}You{05} thieves...{02}{00}
#1287 Hahh... We're sure to see{03}a drop in business{03}after this eruption.{02}{00}
#1288 We will help you anytime,{03}as long as you are{03}pure of heart.{02}{00}
#1289 The healer must be{03}worried about...{01}Oh, never mind.{03}It's not your{03}problem.{02}{00}
#128A If you can ease your{03}anxieties like that,{03}then go right ahead...{02}{00}
#128B I wonder if we'll ever{03}see our stolen gold{03}statue again...{02}{00}
#128C The guests upstairs{03}weren't in their room{03}during the eruption.{01}We searched the room{03}afterwards, but we{03}couldn't find anything.{02}{00}
#128D Everyone thinks our{03}guests are the thieves,{01}but I think it's unfair{03}to accuse them without{03}any evidence.{01}Sure, they look suspicious,{03}but they've been quite{03}polite. And they paid cash!{02}{00}
#128E Those three strangers{03}sure have fooled the{03}innkeeper and his wife.{01}They're the type of people{03}who think they can{03}get away with anything.{02}{00}
#128F A fiery rock burnt a{03}hole through the roof.{01}Sheesh! It's always me{03}who has to take care{03}of these things!{02}{00}
#1290 That kid {11}{03}...{03}He creeps me out...{01}He just came and{03}grabbed my arm...{01}I shook him off because{03}he made me uncomfortable.{02}{00}
#1291 We haven't done{03}anything. You're a{03}terrible person if you{01}start accusing people{03}for no good reason.{02}{00}
#1292 It would be awful if{03}our guests turned out{03}to be the thieves!{02}{00}
#1293 That volcano cost us a{03}lot of business, and{03}now this robbery!{01}Those three are paying{03}us a lot of money.{01}I'll stick up for{03}them if there's{03}any trouble.{02}{00}
#1294 The master and his wife{03}are blinded by money.{01}They'll be in trouble if{03}they don't help search{03}for the thieves.{02}{00}
#1295 Fix the roof...?{01}Why pay for a carpenter{03}when I can just hammer{03}it a bit myself?{02}{00}
#1296 What do you want?{02}{00}
#1297 It looks like that{03}weird kid is with them!{02}{00}
#1298 I can't stand him.{03}Don't let him near{03}me!{02}{00}
#1299 They're acting{03}suspicious. Something's{03}not right...{02}{00}
#129A But you can't use Mind{03}Read if they keep running{03}away, can you?{1E}{00}
#129B Isn't there any way I{03}can catch them?{02}{00}
#129C There should be a way{03}to read them, but how?{02}{00}
#129D Maybe the three of us{03}can surround one of them.{02}{00}
#129E Don't worry! This is{03}going to work!{02}{00}
#129F {11}{01}, you take{03}the lead.{02}{00}
#12A0 Hey, they're back!{02}{00}
#12A1 Uh-oh! They're comin' for{03}us one-on-one!{02}{00}
#12A2 Do whatever it takes...{03}Just keep away from{03}them, like before!{02}{00}
#12A3 There's nowhere to run!{02}{00}
#12A4 Uh-oh! I'm surrounded!{02}{00}
#12A5 Now, {11}{03}!{02}{00}
#12A6 A-All right!{02}{00}
#12A7 Wha-What is this?{03}What is he doing?!{02}{00}
#12A8 He shut his eyes...{03}What's he doin'?{02}{00}
#12A9 Are you done, {11}{03}?{02}{00}
#12AA You creepy freaks...{03}You'll never come near{03}me again!{02}{00}
#12AB Scram! Get outta here!{02}{00}
#12AC Ow! Stop it!{02}{00}
#12AD No! Leave me alone!{02}{00}
#12AE What did you{03}learn, {11}{03}?{02}{00}
#12AF It's them, all right.{03}I think they took a{03}lot of other things, too.{02}{00}
#12B0 It looks like they're{03}hiding it all somewhere{03}in this inn...{02}{00}
#12B1 But they won't let{03}me near them again.{02}{00}
#12B2 Then, I guess we have{03}no other choice{18}we have{03}to search the inn...{1E}{00}
#12B3 It's a lot to cover,{03}but we're the only ones{03}who can do it, right?{1E}{00}
#12B4 Please, {11}{01}...{03}I beg you...{1E}{00}
#12B5 It cannot be done...?{02}{00}
#12B6 Don't worry, {11}{03}.{02}{00}
#12B7 He's just saying no{03}because he doesn't feel{03}confident...{02}{00}
#12B8 But when it really comes{03}down to it, he'll help.{03}It's just the way he is.{02}{00}
#12B9 I trust your sense of{03}duty!{02}{00}
#12BA Well, if that's the case,{03}then let's go, {11}{03}.{02}{00}
#12BB We don't have time for{03}that, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#12BC Leave it to us!{02}{00}
#12BD {11}{01} always comes{03}through!{02}{00}
#12BE I trust your{03}sense of duty!{02}{00}
#12BF Well, it's decided.{03}Let's go, {11}{03}.{02}{00}
#12C0 He should be fixing the{03}roof now, but I can't find{03}him anywhere...{01}He's probably in back,{03}slacking off again.{02}{00}
#12C1 That sneak...{03}He's just wasting time{03}instead of fixing the roof!{02}{00}
#12C2 Wow! {11}{01}'s Psynergy{03}can move things, huh?{03}That's incredible...{02}{00}
#12C3 Uhnn... Uhnn...{02}{00}
#12C4 Ahh! Help me...{02}{00}
#12C5 {10} cut him free{03}from the ropes.{02}{00}
#12C6 I came into this loft{03}while I was fixing the{03}roof...{02}{00}
#12C7 But I found I couldn't{03}get all the way to{03}the back of the loft...{01}So I was looking into it{03}when{05} WHAM!{02}{00}
#12C8 Someone whacked me in{03}the head from behind!{01}When I came to, I was all{03}tied up.{02}{00}
#12C9 Strange... I don't{03}remember all these crates{03}being up here before!{02}{00}
#12CA Maybe all that stolen{03}stuff is in these crates...{02}{00}
#12CB Looks like we've been{03}found out!{02}{00}
#12CC You're pretty persistent{03}for one of Hammet's{03}whelps, kid!{02}{00}
#12CD Why are you working{03}so hard for Hammet?{03}What's it to you?{02}{00}
#12CE Anyway, Hammet's already{03}been caught by a worse{03}bunch of thieves than us!{02}{00}
#12CF I hear Hammet fled{03}to Lunpa after the{03}eruption.{02}{00}
#12D0 Did you say Lunpa!?{02}{00}
#12D1 A man with Master{03}Hammet's money shouldn't{03}go anywhere NEAR Lunpa!{02}{00}
#12D2 What kind of place{03}is Lunpa?{02}{00}
#12D3 The town was named after{03}its founder, Lunpa,{03}the noble thief...{02}{00}
#12D4 That family of thieves{03}remained noble even when{03}his son, Donpa, took over.{02}{00}
#12D5 But Donpa's son,{03}Dodonpa, is{03}an evil thief.{02}{00}
#12D6 The man has no morals.{03}I've heard he's truly{03}vicious.{02}{00}
#12D7 See, we're not so{03}bad. How about it?{03}Will you let us go?{1E}{00}
#12D8 Seriously? If we return{03}all the stolen goods and{03}repent, you'll let us go?{02}{00}
#12D9 You must be joking!{03}We stole this stuff fair{03}and square!{02}{00}
#12DA We'll just have to{03}keep you quiet!{02}{00}
#12DB And there's only one{03}way to do that!{03}Get 'em!!!{02}{00}
#12DC What? You mean, even{03}if we return everything{03}we stole and apologize,{01}it's still a crime?{02}{00}
#12DD These kids are nothing{03}to worry about.{02}{00}
#12DE {09}{04}Uhnn... Ohh...{02}{00}
#12DF You'll stay here as{03}our hostages!{02}{00}
#12E0 Keep your mouth shut{03}if you want to help{03}him!{02}{00}
#12E1 They won't go away,{03}will they? They're back!{02}{00}
#12E2 We'll just have to{03}punish them again!{02}{00}
#12E3 We'll make you sorry{03}you were ever born!{03}Get em!!{02}{00}
#12E4 They...{05} They got us...{02}{00}
#12E5 Actually, for a second{03}there, I thought we{03}were goners...{02}{00}
#12E6 Wow! We won!{02}{00}
#12E7 I...{03}I'll get the mayor!{02}{00}
#12E8 After all the trouble{03}we went to, stealing{03}all this stuff...{02}{00}
#12E9 Haven't you heard?{03}Stealing from others is{03}wrong!{02}{00}
#12EA Sheesh! I told you...{03}I told you we should{03}have skipped town...{02}{00}
#12EB Evil never prevails!{02}{00}
#12EC If you'll give me{03}Master Hammet's rod, I'll{03}head to Lunpa now.{02}{00}
#12ED What will you two be{03}doing, {11}{01}?{02}{00}
#12EE I suppose we have to{03}go after {11}{05} and{03}the others...{02}{00}
#12EF He's reading our minds{03}again! Shouldn't we{03}stop him?{1E}{00}
#12F0 It's too late, {11}{01}.{03}He's already done.{02}{00}
#12F1 If you say so, {11}{01}...{02}{00}
#12F2 I see...{03}So that's what happened...{02}{00}
#12F3 These are the thieves,{03}Mayor...{02}{00}
#12F4 What you did was horrid.{03}Stealing? In the middle of{03}a disaster!?!{02}{00}
#12F5 Hey, you're the ones who{03}left all your doors open!{01}You were practically{03}begging us to{18}OUCH!{02}{00}
#12F6 Sorry... I couldn't{03}help myself...{02}{00}
#12F7 What should we do{03}with them?{02}{00}
#12F8 We're going to lock{03}them up for a long,{03}long time.{02}{00}
#12F9 Hey, wake up!{02}{00}
#12FA Let's go{18}get up! Get up!{02}{00}
#12FB Hey, can you help me{03}tie them up?{02}{00}
#12FC Hey, you! {11}{01}, right?{03}I won't forget this!{02}{00}
#12FD Take them away!{02}{00}
#12FE Thank you for catching{03}the thieves! You have{03}our sincerest gratitude.{02}{00}
#12FF Really, you were{03}a big help!{02}{00}
#1300 Let's take a look{03}at what they stole.{02}{00}
#1301 Found the mayor's{03}precious urn.{02}{00}
#1302 Mayor... Isn't that{03}your family's urn?{02}{00}
#1303 My precious urn{03}has been returned.{02}{00}
#1304 Found a gold statue.{02}{00}
#1305 Hey, that belongs in the...{03}They stole from our{03}Sanctum? Those monsters!{02}{00}
#1306 The town's treasures...{03}They're back at last.{02}{00}
#1307 Mayor, we found another{03}chest over here, you see?{02}{00}
#1308 {11}{03}, isn't this what{03}you were looking for?{02}{00}
#1309 Now, you can return to{03}Master Hammet!{02}{00}
#130A That's right! I heard that{03}Master Hammet was seen{03}heading toward Lunpa!{02}{00}
#130B Oh no... Dodonpa{03}wouldn't miss an{03}opportunity like that...{02}{00}
#130C I'm certain that{03}your master has{03}been{05} kidnapped.{02}{00}
#130D How can I rescue{03}Master Hammet?{02}{00}
#130E No one can enter once{03}the gates are closed.{02}{00}
#130F What will happen{03}to Master Hammet?{02}{00}
#1310 Calm down, {11}{03}. Master{03}Hammet is probably{03}still alive and unharmed.{02}{00}
#1311 Dodonpa knows that he{03}can use Hammet to extort{03}a ransom from Kalay.{02}{00}
#1312 We can't do much until{03}Dodonpa makes his move,{01}but at least we know{03}Hammet's safe...for now.{02}{00}
#1313 Your name is {11}{01},{03}right?{02}{00}
#1314 And you are...{02}{00}
#1315 It's {11}{02}.{02}{00}
#1316 Thank you both.{03}You have my deepest{03}gratitude.{02}{00}
#1317 Well. Let's go then.{02}{00}
#1318 Before you leave town,{03}please come see me.{03}I have something for you.{02}{00}
#1319 What a mess...{03}We finally get the rod{03}back, and now this.{02}{00}
#131A I wish I could cheer{03}you up... You look{03}so depressed...{02}{00}
#131B I just want to rescue{03}Master Hammet...{03}That's all...{02}{00}
#131C But I couldn't ask you{03}two to help me.{02}{00}
#131D You have a very...{03}important mission,{03}right?{02}{00}
#131E That's right. I saw it{03}in your minds.{02}{00}
#131F I had no idea that{03}the volcano's eruption{03}held such a secret!{02}{00}
#1320 Yes, we have to find{03}{11}{05} and his gang,{03}or we'll all be in trouble.{02}{00}
#1321 Then, I suppose this{03}is good-bye, then.{1E}{00}
#1322 {11}{01} said he{03}would help you, {11}{03}...{02}{00}
#1323 No, you've already done{03}so much for me. I couldn't{03}impose on you any further.{02}{00}
#1324 {11}{03} got the{03}Shaman's Rod.{02}{00}
#1325 I shall never forget{03}this town's hospitality...{03}I wish you all the best.{02}{00}
#1326 Well, I guess we'd{03}better get moving, too.{02}{00}
#1327 Are you leaving?{03}I'm still worried{03}about the rod,{01}so I'll just wait here{03}until you two return.{02}{00}
#1328 Welcome back, you two!{03}Let's go find the rod!{02}{00}
#1329 What? It's still a crime,{03}even if we return{03}everything...{01}AND we're really,{03}really sorry?{02}{00}
#132A Oh, wait, I don't want to{03}take your Djinni.{01}I'll just leave it{03}with {11}{01}.{03}Hurry back!{02}{00}
#132B Did you see something{03}strange over there?{03}I fought it, but it fled.{01}When I returned, I saw{03}it again... I wonder{03}if it likes this place.{02}{00}
#132C Hmmm...{03}It must be hiding{03}somewhere again...{02}{00}
#132D It just whacked me{03}in the head and{03}then ran away...{01}Next time I see it,{03}I'll be the one doing{03}the whacking.{02}{00}
#132E I knowits kind...{03}It'll be back,{03}sooner or later.{02}{00}
#132F You got it?{03}Wow, that's pretty{03}impressive!{01}Keep your eyes peeled{03}for others like it.{02}{00}
#1330 So, you're hitting{03}the road again?{1E}{00}
#1331 Well, you'll always be{03}welcome here in Vault!{02}{00}
#1332 Ha! You say that now,{03}but you'll leave anyway,{03}right?{02}{00}
#1333 Smoke is still rising from{03}Mt. Aleph... I think{03}it might erupt again.{02}{00}
#1334 Master Hammet, the{03}wealthy merchant... I hear{03}he never reached Kalay.{02}{00}
#1335 It's great that you{03}caught those thieves!{02}{00}
#1336 Are you talking about{03}Hammet's servant, {11}{03}?{03}He went out to Lunpa.{02}{00}
#1337 I see, {11}{03}... I guess{03}it was impossible to{03}rescue Master Hammet.{02}{00}
#1338 The eruption devastated{03}roads throughout Angara...{01}When the southern bridge{03}is repaired, you can{03}head toward Kalay...{02}{00}
#1339 {11}{03} didn't go to{03}Lunpa all alone,{03}did he?{02}{00}
#133A Heh heh... I shouldn't have{03}worried about {11}{03}...{01}When did he join up{03}with you, {11}{01}?{02}{00}
#133B Everyone is very{03}grateful that you{03}captured the thieves!{02}{00}
#133C Those men you captured...{03}They're in jail now?{1E}{00}
#133D It's been a long time{03}since we had to use{03}our prison.{02}{00}
#133E They're just upset, saying{03}all kinds of nasty things.{03}It's sad, really...{01}Maybe you should go{03}see them.{02}{00}
#133F Are you the ones who{03}captured the thieves?{1E}{00}
#1340 I just wish more young{03}people had your sense{03}of honor.{02}{00}
#1341 So brave, and{03}yet so humble!{01}I wish all young people{03}would learn from your{03}humility.{02}{00}
#1342 Ruff!{05} Rrruff!!{02}{00}
#1343 You've made our town{03}peaceful at last...{01}I wish you could stay{03}here forever.{02}{00}
#1344 Now Mt. Aleph has calmed{03}down a little, I'm going to{03}climb up into the crater!{02}{00}
#1345 Of all the places...{03}Why would Master Hammet{03}go to a town like Lunpa?{01}I can't understand{03}how rich people think...{02}{00}
#1346 How should we{03}punish our prisoners?{01}Public humiliation?{03}Or perhaps a beating!{02}{00}
#1347 Nobody gets into Lunpa{03}except for thieves{03}and their victims.{01}You should just give{03}up on rescuing Hammet.{02}{00}
#1348 With the road out, the{03}only way out is through{03}the cave in Goma Range.{02}{00}
#1349 Where did {11}{03} go{03}all by himself?{03}I'm so worried...{02}{00}
#134A But when did they{03}join {11}{03}?{02}{00}
#134B You must be stronger{03}than you look to have{03}captured those thieves.{02}{00}
#134C I feel much better{03}now that those thieves{03}are behind bars!{02}{00}
#134D There is always a fight{03}when capturing thieves.{01}I don't really care{03}for danger like that...{02}{00}
#134E If you bring me a{03}bone, I'll tell you{03}something useful.{02}{00}
#134F Awwww!!{02}{00}
#1350 Ruff ruff ruff!!!{02}{00}
#1351 How did you know I{03}wanted one of these?{02}{00}
#1352 I can sleep well,{03}now that the thieves{03}have been locked up.{01}I kept worrying that{03}they would take my gem.{02}{00}
#1353 Thank goodness those{03}thieves were captured{03}before they stole our gem.{02}{00}
#1354 Everybody's after my{03}rock! They want it{03}for themselves!{01}I can't let my guard{03}down for a second!{02}{00}
#1355 What if that rock is{03}worthless? Maybe that's{03}why they didn't steal it.{02}{00}
#1356 Did those thieves{03}come from Lunpa?{1E}{00}
#1357 The town's master is{03}Dodonpa, the grandson{03}of Lunpa himself!{01}He's an awful man, and{03}capturing his thieves{03}can only mean trouble.{02}{00}
#1358 The Lunpans were noble{03}thieves under the rule{03}of Lunpa's son, Donpa.{01}It's all Dodonpa's fault{03}that they turned{03}bad!{02}{00}
#1359 My father is so{03}worried about those{03}prisoners from Lunpa.{01}You'll protect us if{03}Dodonpa and his men{03}come to attack us, right?{02}{00}
#135A The reason Lunpa turned{03}bad is because Donpa{03}spoiled his son, Dodonpa.{02}{00}
#135B Father looks so sad,{03}worrying like that.{02}{00}
#135C The thieves hid the{03}stolen treasure in{03}the hotel's loft...{01}and they hid other stolen{03}goods in the cemetery.{02}{00}
#135D Just as I thought,{03}nothing was stolen{03}from our house.{02}{00}
#135E I guess nothing in our{03}house was valuable{03}enough to steal.{01}I have mixed feelings{03}about that...{02}{00}
#135F I wish I had something{03}worth stealing!{02}{00}
#1360 You were such{03}a great help, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#1361 Allow us to show{03}you our gratitude,{03}like we promised.{02}{00}
#1362 Received {14}{02}.{02}{00}
#1363 Oh no, {11}{01} and{03}his friends have{03}too many items!{01}Please come back{03}when you organize{03}your things.{02}{00}
#1364 Are you heading out{03}beyond Goma Range,{03}by any chance?{1E}{00}
#1365 Look for a cave in the{03}mountains of the Goma{03}Range, northeast of us.{01}Once you've passed it,{03}you'll reach Bilibin.{02}{00}
#1366 Hmm... There's no other{03}way to get out of here{03}right now.{02}{00}
#1367 You're the person{03}who got our urn back,{03}aren't you?{01}Thank you so much.{02}{00}
#1368 I heard you defeated{03}those thieves!{1E}{00}
#1369 I suppose you really can't{03}judge people by their{03}looks...{02}{00}
#136A Really? My father said{03}you were the ones who{03}captured the thieves...{02}{00}
#136B {11}{03} learned a{03}lot by talking{03}with animals...{02}{00}
#136C The cave in the Goma{03}Range is a dangerous{03}place, but you'll be okay.{02}{00}
#136D I'm so relieved now that{03}we have our family urn{03}back, safe and sound.{02}{00}
#136E When I grow up,{03}I want to be just as{03}strong as you!{02}{00}
#136F ...I wish I had{03}wings like a bird...{01}I want to be free...{03}to fly to the furthest{03}reaches of the sky.{02}{00}
#1370 We found our stolen{03}weapons in the cemetery,{03}but they were all rusted.{01}We have to sharpen{03}them before we can{03}sell them to anyone.{02}{00}
#1371 My weapons were found in{03}the cemetery. Hey, what's{03}that supposed to mean?{01}Is someone trying to{03}tell us our weapons{03}are too old?{02}{00}
#1372 If you're gonna head into{03}the cave in Goma Range,{03}you should be prepared.{02}{00}
#1373 It must be snowing up{03}in Imil, north of{03}the Goma Range.{02}{00}
#1374 With the bridge out, it{03}will be quite a while 'til{03}we can go to Kalay again.{02}{00}
#1375 Why are these people{03}so anxious to leave?{02}{00}
#1376 It was the hand of fate{03}that returned the gold{03}statue to our Sanctum.{02}{00}
#1377 When you stray from your{03}worldly path, fate will{03}guide you on your course.{02}{00}
#1378 Go on...{03}if that eases the{03}anxiety in your mind...{02}{00}
#1379 This child has awakened{03}to our teachings!{03}Guide him well.{02}{00}
#137A I'm shocked! Those guests{03}of ours turned out to be{03}thieves!?{02}{00}
#137B They hid all those stolen{03}goods in our loft?{01}Well, at least we nabbed{03}the thieves and the{03}town's peaceful again.{02}{00}
#137C I have a lot of leftover{03}bones from dinner.{03}Here, do you want some?{1E}{00}
#137D Really?{03}Take as many{03}as you want.{02}{00}
#137E Well, I don't blame you.{03}A growing boy can't live{03}on bones alone.{02}{00}
#137F Thank you for the other{03}day. Are you leaving{03}town already?{01}I'll be praying for{03}your safety.{02}{00}
#1380 Who could have{03}known they were{03}thieves?{01}Well, at least we got{03}some business. That's{03}not too bad, right?{02}{00}
#1381 Of course, I always{03}suspected they were{03}up to no good.{02}{00}
#1382 Gee...{03}I always get so hungry{03}when I'm cooking...{01}It wouldn't kill me{03}to taste just a little{03}bit, would it?{02}{00}
#1383 Sniff... Ah... The smell{03}of cooking meat...{01}No one will notice if I{03}take a little bite!{02}{00}
#1384 Wow, you have so many{03}things. Aren't you{03}a greedy lad!{02}{00}
#1385 What? You want more{03}bones?{1E}{00}
#1386 Go ahead...{03}Take as many as{03}you want.{02}{00}
#1387 I don't blame you.{01}Only a dog would be{03}happy eating nothing{03}but bones.{02}{00}
#1388 If only we had escaped{03}to the cave northeast{03}of Goma Range.{02}{00}
#1389 Blast! I knew we should{03}have skipped town sooner.{02}{00}
#138A Shut yer yaps!{02}{00}
#138B They got us this time,{03}but next time...{03}Oh, they'll pay for this!{02}{00}
#138C Sigh...{03}Will I ever{03}run free again?{02}{00}
#138D I wonder if this is{03}because we stole{03}Hammet's Shaman's Rod.{02}{00}
#138E I'll be out of this{03}jail before you know it.{03}You'll see!{02}{00}
#138F It's no use. Our Psynergy{03}isn't strong enough{03}to free that stump.{02}{00}
#1390 You want to move{03}the stump, right?{02}{00}
#1391 It looks like it's{03}trapped in the ivy.{02}{00}
#1392 Isn't there anything{03}we can do?{02}{00}
#1393 I know!{02}{00}
#1394 I have a great idea.{03}Leave it to me!{02}{00}
#1395 All right, {11}{03}!{02}{00}
#1396 I did it!{02}{00}
#1397 ...Thanks for the help.{05}{03}But why are you here,{03}{11}{03}?{02}{00}
#1398 I couldn't get{03}into Lunpa...{02}{00}
#1399 Don't get me wrong!{05}{03}I didn't come here{03}to ask for your help.{02}{00}
#139A Your quest has been{03}on my mind ever{03}since I left Vault.{02}{00}
#139B Remember? I read{03}everything that{03}happened in your minds.{02}{00}
#139C I couldn't just leave,{03}not with all these{03}terrible things happening.{02}{00}
#139D If I can't rescue Master{03}Hammet, then I want{03}to help you...{02}{00}
#139E Please, allow me to{03}join your quest.{02}{00}
#139F Are you trying to get{03}to Bilibin through{03}this cave?{02}{00}
#13A0 Then let's go!{02}{00}
#13A1 Mother, look!!{03}A boulder blocking{03}the road!!{02}{00}
#13A2 You moved that boulder!{02}{00}
#13A3 We can go now, Mother,{03}can't we?{02}{00}
#13A4 How did you get{03}locked up in here?{02}{00}
#13A5 We came here to{03}escape the eruption{03}of Mt. Aleph.{02}{00}
#13A6 When we got here, that{03}boulder fell in a landslide,{01}and we couldn't go{03}any further.{02}{00}
#13A7 Then some strange men{03}blocked the other end{03}with a barricade.{02}{00}
#13A8 How did you move the{03}boulder without touching{03}it?{02}{00}
#13A9 I hope we don't get{03}trapped by another{03}boulder!{02}{00}
#13AA Tell me the truth, now.{03}Did Alchemy caused that{03}eruption on Mt. Aleph?{02}{00}
#13AB A careful search will{03}{05}reveal{05} a passage leading{03}underground nearby.{01}You might just find{03}some treasure inside!{02}{00}
#13AC Bilibin lies{03}to the east.{02}{00}
#13AD Far to the north, you'll{03}find Imil.{02}{00}
#13AE It's a tree, but{03}it almost looks like...{03}a man?{02}{00}
#13AF It looks like{03}a living person.{02}{00}
#13B0 Help me... Somebody...{02}{00}
#13B1 Welcome to Bilibin!{03}Please, just ignore that{03}strange tree out front!{01}Many brave warriors have{03}been sent to Kolima.{03}Travelers needn't worry!{02}{00}
#13B2 I hear a large group{03}crossed over Goma Range,{03}heading toward Imil.{02}{00}
#13B3 Did you see the tree{03}at the entrance?{1E}{00}
#13B4 That tree was once a{03}man... He came to our{03}village under a curse.{01}His last words were that{03}he had offended the{03}sacred tree...{02}{00}
#13B5 I can't believe you missed{03}the tree... You should{03}look around some more.{02}{00}
#13B6 Lord McCoy has been{03}quite frightened{03}since the incident.{02}{00}
#13B7 Have you tried heading{03}southeast from here?{1E}{00}
#13B8 That barricade was built{03}because there's been{03}trouble in Kolima.{02}{00}
#13B9 The road is blocked, so{03}you might as well{03}not even bother.{01}I heard they put a{03}massive barricade up...{02}{00}
#13BA The road to Kolima{03}is blocked now, as per{03}Lord McCoy's orders.{02}{00}
#13BB Ever since that man{03}turned into a tree,{03}everyone has been{01}too scared to go near{03}the town's entrance.{02}{00}
#13BC Is it true that a{03}mountain exploded on{03}the other side of Goma?{01}The sky was a brilliant{03}red that day.{03}It was a beautiful sight.{02}{00}
#13BD There's a tower at the{03}tip of Imil that people{03}say was built by the gods!{01}Everyone there calls{03}it the lighthouse.{02}{00}
#13BE Something{05} changed{03}in the eruption.{01}Now, all sorts of strange{03}creatures lurk in every{03}forest and mountain!{02}{00}
#13BF The lumber I ordered{03}from Kolima disappeared{03}after the{05} incident.{02}{00}
#13C0 Have you seen the{03}barricade we built on{03}the road to Kolima?{1E}{00}
#13C1 It's pretty shabby,{03}because it was built{03}on short notice...{01}I had no idea it was{03}meant to block the{03}road to Kolima.{02}{00}
#13C2 It's off to the east,{03}if you want to see it.{01}It was a rush job, so{03}I had to take some{03}shortcuts.{02}{00}
#13C3 Are you telling me that{03}I'm responsible for this?{1E}{00}
#13C4 Sure, I had them cut the{03}tree down so I could{03}build my palace!{01}But if anyone is a victim,{03}it's me! I've been waiting{03}for my palace for months!{02}{00}
#13C5 That curse of the tree{03}spirit is a foolish{03}old superstition!{01}I just want to live{03}in a big palace!{02}{00}
#13C6 You guys are so unlucky,{03}arriving in Bilibin at{03}such a scary time.{02}{00}
#13C7 You must be mad!{03}It's almost winter, and{03}you're going to Imil?{02}{00}
#13C8 We ended up like this{03}because of Lady McCoy's{03}foolishness.{01}If only she hadn't wanted{03}to live like a queen...{02}{00}
#13C9 Everyone gets worried{03}when town leaders get{03}scared.{01}I wonder if we can still{03}rely on Lord McCoy.{02}{00}
#13CA Where did these{03}kids come from?{02}{00}
#13CB No one would dare go{03}after what happened{03}last time.{02}{00}
#13CC He begged for help as he{03}turned into a tree, but{03}no one would help him.{01}Is that how all{03}grown-ups are?{02}{00}
#13CD I want to see{03}that pretty sky again...{02}{00}
#13CE Only great Adepts{03}can enter the{03}Lighthouse of Imil.{02}{00}
#13CF That explosion must have{03}been a sign of some{03}big disaster.{01}I'm scared!{02}{00}
#13D0 If things like this are{03}going to keep happening,{01}maybe we should stop{03}building that palace.{02}{00}
#13D1 I am glad I didn't{03}know Kolima was involved{03}in that incident...{01}If I had, I wouldn't{03}have done it,{03}no matter what.{02}{00}
#13D2 If all this trouble{03}was caused by the{03}sacred tree,{01}then all we have{03}to do is cut the{03}tree down!{02}{00}
#13D3 That tree at the entrance{03}is really a man cursed{03}by the sacred tree!{01}It's all because McCoy,{03}the lord of this town, cut{03}down all those trees.{02}{00}
#13D4 McCoy had the trees cut{03}down so he could build{03}his wife a grand palace.{02}{00}
#13D5 This is all Lord{03}McCoy's fault, but we{03}can't say anything...{01}He is our leader,{03}after all.{02}{00}
#13D6 Ah, Lady McCoy...{03}I would just{03}love to be her.{01}Will I ever live{03}in a lovely palace?{02}{00}
#13D7 The snow is already piling{03}up in Imil, and{03}the weather is freezing.{01}If I were you, I'd{03}wait until spring{03}to go there.{02}{00}
#13D8 We rarely see any snow{03}around Bilibin.{02}{00}
#13D9 When spring comes, I want{03}to go see that{03}angelic {11}{04} again.{02}{00}
#13DA It must be difficult{03}to live in a snowy town.{01}I think I'll just{03}stay here.{02}{00}
#13DB How are people doing{03}in Kolima?{03}I've been worried...{02}{00}
#13DC I know that guy who{03}turned into the tree...{03}I remember his clothes.{02}{00}
#13DD I can't imagine that{03}everyone in Kolima turned{03}into a tree, but...{02}{00}
#13DE He seemed so happy, and{03}then he turned into{03}a tree!{01}What if that happened{03}to me?{02}{00}
#13DF Long ago, the lighthouse{03}near Imil held the{03}Water of Hermes,{01}a magical liquid that{03}could heal all injuries.{02}{00}
#13E0 But even the legendary{03}Water of Hermes cannot{03}turn back time.{01}If only there were a{03}potion that could{03}restore youth.{02}{00}
#13E1 Could the Water of{03}Hermes save a man who{03}had turned into a tree?{02}{00}
#13E2 The Water of Hermes{03}vanished long ago.{01}After all, nothing lasts{03}forever.{02}{00}
#13E3 There was an able healer{03}in a village called Vale,{03}but he is gone now.{02}{00}
#13E4 The world will never see{03}such a great healer again.{02}{00}
#13E5 Have you ever heard{03}of the 'ocean'?{1E}{00}
#13E6 If you travel over the{03}ocean to far, far away,{03}you'll find another world.{01}They say the world of{03}misty darkness begins{03}there.{02}{00}
#13E7 The ocean is immense...{03}You would want to sing if{03}you ever saw the ocean.{02}{00}
#13E8 I wish I could see another{03}world! If I were a{03}little younger...{02}{00}
#13E9 You must be used to{03}all types of danger,{03}being travelers and all.{01}Lord McCoy could use{03}someone like you.{02}{00}
#13EA Only someone really{03}brave would go{03}somewhere so scary.{02}{00}
#13EB A curse on Kolima?{03}What a scary development!{02}{00}
#13EC You can't reach Kolima,{03}no matter how you try.{02}{00}
#13ED I'm really worried{03}about Kolima. I was{03}born there, you know?{01}I can't even focus{03}on my cooking.{02}{00}
#13EE Hey, Mister Head Chef!{03}Are you going to cook{03}or not?{01}Customers are waiting!{02}{00}
#13EF Start cooking{03}already!{02}{00}
#13F0 Grrr...{02}{00}
#13F1 Did you hear a sound?{03}You heard it, right?{1E}{00}
#13F2 I can't hear anything{03}over the growling{03}of my stomach!{01}I'm dizzy with hunger.{02}{00}
#13F3 {09}{04}Oooh...{07} It's been so long{03}since I ordered...{03}My stomach's rumbling.{01}Where's my dinner!?{02}{00}
#13F4 We came here because{03}Lord McCoy was building{03}his wife a palace.{01}I wonder if they stopped{03}because of the curse?{02}{00}
#13F5 I think that big tree{03}deep in the forest{03}looks suspicious!{02}{00}
#13F6 Do you believe a tree{03}spirit can curse a man?{1E}{00}
#13F7 It's hard not to believe{03}after you've seen{03}that tree out front!{02}{00}
#13F8 Really? Then go see{03}Lord McCoy and listen{03}to his story!{02}{00}
#13F9 I can't wait to see{03}today's special!{03}Yippee!{02}{00}
#13FA I went to Lord McCoy{03}looking for work...{01}I'm too scared to{03}accept the job{03}alone, though...{02}{00}
#13FB I've heard songs that{03}tell of ancient trees{03}developing strange powers.{01}Maybe that power is{03}what caused{05} the {09}{04}curse{07}.{02}{00}
#13FC I don't believe in curses{03}from ancient trees.{02}{00}
#13FD Any travelers heading{03}east are stuck here until{03}the road opens up.{01}Until then, I'm gonna{03}make lots of money!{02}{00}
#13FE Father, Mother...{03}I hope they're all right.{01}I wish I could go{03}home and see them{03}right away.{02}{00}
#13FF Should I just forget{03}that I'm a newcomer{03}and just start cooking?{02}{00}
#1400 I've had all the customer{03}complaints I want!{02}{00}
#1401 Arghhh! That's it...{03}I just want to scream{03}with hunger!{01}But I still have to{03}smile... Boy, it's tough{03}being a businessman.{02}{00}
#1402 I came to Bilibin hoping{03}to sell furniture.{03}Instead, all I get is...{01}a palace nobody's building{03}and a restaurant that{03}won't serve me my food.{02}{00}
#1403 I see why they call that{03}big tree in Kolima{03}Forest the sacred tree.{02}{00}
#1404 I don't care who does it.{03}Just undo that{03}curse, now!{02}{00}
#1405 Yippee! Is it ready yet?{03}My mouth is watering{03}just thinking about it.{02}{00}
#1406 I'm getting a little scared{03}hearing all these stories{03}from the villagers.{02}{00}
#1407 It has been said that{03}a fairy named Tret{03}lives inside the holy tree.{02}{00}
#1408 I am starting to feel{03}that this is only{03}a beginning.{02}{00}
#1409 Please, give me strength{03}at times like these...{02}{00}
#140A Will I turn into a{03}tree someday, too?{03}How terrible...{02}{00}
#140B Someone will save us!{03}Just keep the faith!{02}{00}
#140C Lord McCoy is so upset{03}about this curse that{03}he can't even eat.{02}{00}
#140D The lord will only{03}meet with brave{03}and mighty warriors.{01}You don't seem the type.{03}Think you're up to it?{1E}{00}
#140E Your honesty is good...{01}But I can't send such{03}inexperienced children{03}to see my lord.{02}{00}
#140F Hmmm, I see...{03}You seem pretty{03}confident...{02}{00}
#1410 What do you say? They{03}look a little young to get{03}involved in this ugly mess.{02}{00}
#1411 Nobody else seems up to{03}the challenge, though.{03}What do we have to lose?{02}{00}
#1412 All right. I shall{03}let you pass.{03}Follow me!{02}{00}
#1413 Lord McCoy is a very{03}difficult man. Be careful{03}how you act around him.{02}{00}
#1414 Where were you?{02}{00}
#1415 Lord McCoy is angry{03}because he couldn't find{03}you.{02}{00}
#1416 The master can be{03}quite cranky.{03}Hurry along, now!{02}{00}
#1417 No one believed they{03}would turn into trees,{03}and yet they all did!{02}{00}
#1418 Is there no one who{03}can aid us now?{02}{00}
#1419 Lord McCoy would never{03}hire anyone so puny{03}as these kids...{02}{00}
#141A You are the only ones{03}I can count on!{03}Please help us.{02}{00}
#141B Really?{03}I can't believe he{03}really asked you.{02}{00}
#141C Don't blame me if{03}you get turned into{03}a tree.{02}{00}
#141D I am beginning to feel{03}rather sorry for{03}you now.{02}{00}
#141E If you want to see{03}Lord McCoy, follow{03}the red carpet.{02}{00}
#141F Make sure you don't{03}offend Lord McCoy!{02}{00}
#1420 Oh, are you willing{03}to go to Kolima Forest?{1E}{00}
#1421 I forget how many{03}people Lord McCoy has{03}hired to end the curse.{01}And yet{05} not a single{03}warrior has returned...{02}{00}
#1422 You don't look too strong,{03}but that may be for{03}the best.{02}{00}
#1423 I always believed that the{03}old tree in Kolima Forest{03}should be protected!{02}{00}
#1424 This is Lady McCoy's{03}room, so don't{03}touch anything.{02}{00}
#1425 How many times do I{03}have to tell them? Why{03}won't they leave me alone?{02}{00}
#1426 They should never have{03}let such young children{03}into the palace!{01}I'll be the one to get{03}yelled at if they break{03}an urn or something!{02}{00}
#1427 Sending these children{03}to Kolima Forest?{01}Do they want more{03}people to suffer the{03}curse?{02}{00}
#1428 I shouldn't have said{03}anything when they were{03}planning the new palace.{01}I think I might have{03}caused them to cut{03}down the holy tree...{02}{00}
#1429 Of all the nerve!{03}Coming into the{03}palace unescorted!?{02}{00}
#142A Milady was renowned far{03}and wide for her beauty!{01}That's why milord is so{03}anxious to please her,{03}regardless of cost.{02}{00}
#142B Oh, someday, I want to{03}sleep in a silk{03}nightgown like this.{02}{00}
#142C Will I ever find someone{03}to make my dreams come{03}true, like milady did?{02}{00}
#142D Oh, no! This nightgown{03}has a hole...{03}Milady will be furious!{02}{00}
#142E You can see Kolima pretty{03}well from here.{01}On sunny days, Lord{03}McCoy comes here to{03}admire the view.{02}{00}
#142F Hmm. It seems the curse{03}of the tree has not yet{03}come to Bilibin.{02}{00}
#1430 Lord McCoy hasn't come{03}here for some time...{01}It's because of the{03}curse, no doubt.{02}{00}
#1431 Kolima Forest used to be{03}so green. Once the holy{03}tree was cut down,{01}everything began to{03}turn brown.{03}Is Kolima Forest dying...?{02}{00}
#1432 What do you think?{03}These are Bilibin's great{03}treasures.{01}Whoever ends the curse{03}can claim these as his{03}own.{02}{00}
#1433 Pick any one of{03}the four treasures.{02}{00}
#1434 Are we really{03}giving our treasure{03}to these wimps?{02}{00}
#1435 You will get the rest{03}when you succeed.{02}{00}
#1436 What good is treasure{03}if you get turned{03}into a tree?{02}{00}
#1437 What's the matter, then?{02}{00}
#1438 Sir!{05} Some new warriors{03}have just arrived{03}in the palace!{02}{00}
#1439 New warriors, yeh say?{02}{00}
#143A We've sent many a man{03}intae Kolima Forest, but{03}not a one has returned.{02}{00}
#143B These{05} warriors...{03}Did yeh get a good{03}look at 'em?{02}{00}
#143C Come closer, laddy.{02}{00}
#143D Hey...{05} Are these the{03}ones yeh were talking{03}about?{02}{00}
#143E They're but children!{02}{00}
#143F And yeh expect me tae{03}believe yeh can save{03}Kolima?{1E}{00}
#1440 Bah! Yeh're too young.{03}Yeh cannae handle{03}the job.{02}{00}
#1441 Yeh can leave now...{02}{00}
#1442 What is it?{05} Yeh've had{03}a change of heart? Yeh{03}want tae help Kolima?{1E}{00}
#1443 Hmmm.{05} Well, I'll grant{03}yeh're a brave lot.{02}{00}
#1444 Here. This key'll get{03}yeh past the barricades{03}tae the east...{02}{00}
#1445 Even with the key, such{03}wee lads as yerselves'll{03}never reach Kolima.{02}{00}
#1446 He's making fun of us!{03}Calling us children!{05}{01}That's just irritating,{03}don't you think, {11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#1447 Are you serious, {11}{01}?{03}It doesn't bother you?{1E}{00}
#1448 Well, don't let him{03}get to you.{01}We'll just have to prove{03}we can handle this job,{03}whatever it is!{02}{00}
#1449 So, yeh've decided{03}to accept our little{03}job?{02}{00}
#144A Hey, {11}{03}! You...{03}You don't look too{03}enthusiastic.{02}{00}
#144B That curse can turn a{03}man into a tree!{05}{01}You think we{03}stand a chance?{02}{00}
#144C What?{05}{03}Yeah, of course we do!{02}{00}
#144D You know we do,{03}right, {11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#144E Come on, {11}{01}!{03}You said you'd do it!{05}{03}We're still going, right?{1E}{00}
#144F Well, if {11}{01}'s going,{03}I guess I'm in, too.{02}{00}
#1450 At least we all agree{03}on something!{02}{00}
#1451 What troubles you,{03}Milord?{05}{03}They seem willing enough...{02}{00}
#1452 They call themselves{03}warriors...but they're{03}naught but wee children!{02}{00}
#1453 Aye, these are desperate{03}times, but I cannae send{03}such wee lads tae their doom!{02}{00}
#1454 Then what will happen{03}to Kolima Forest?{02}{00}
#1455 We cannae give up hope{03}on our other champions!{02}{00}
#1456 But... But what about us?{02}{00}
#1457 We cannae send yeh{03}intae certain doom.{02}{00}
#1458 What if we said{03}that we were going{03}east anyway?{02}{00}
#1459 Yeh can go once things{03}have settled down.{02}{00}
#145A But that means...{03}you're not going to{03}let us go?{02}{00}
#145B Ach, it's fer yer{03}own good, lad.{02}{00}
#145C I dinnae want tae talk{03}about it anymore.{03}Captain?{02}{00}
#145D I'm sorry,{05}{03}but you should leave now.{02}{00}
#145E Your name was...{11}{01}?{03}I'm sorry you were{03}rejected.{02}{00}
#145F I never, ever, expected{03}anything like this to{03}happen to Bilibin.{02}{00}
#1460 Will you promise me{03}you won't go to Kolima?{1E}{00}
#1461 That's good.{02}{00}
#1462 You are persistent,{03}aren't you?{02}{00}
#1463 That barricade...{05}{03}You{05} may not need a key.{02}{00}
#1464 Oops...{05} I shouldn't have{03}said anything.{02}{00}
#1465 Well, I'm going to go now.{02}{00}
#1466 Sorry, lads, but Kolima's{03}future is best left to{03}more experienced men.{02}{00}
#1467 Hey!{03}If you can't do the job,{03}you don't get the reward!{02}{00}
#1468 I can't tell you{03}anything else.{01}So don't even ask!{02}{00}
#1469 What a shame, huh?{03}I guess you need to{03}be a little older.{02}{00}
#146A There is nothing more{03}to talk about!{01}Tell them to go.{03}I don't care how{03}often they return!{02}{00}
#146B It's a tough thing,{03}being so young.{01}They dinnae ken{03}what it means to be{03}afraid.{02}{00}
#146C That barricade is pretty{03}shabby... It was{03}rushed, you see?{01}The hinges on the{03}barricade are quite noisy.{03}They might break easily.{02}{00}
#146D I didn't think they'd{03}let you go...{03}You're too young!{02}{00}
#146E McCoy's Hidden Warehouse{03}     Do Not Enter!{02}{00}
#146F Even frozen Imil must{03}feel warm with that{03}wonderful {11}{04} around!{02}{00}
#1470 There is a tree that{03}looks like a person.{02}{00}
#1471 They're...{05} so heavy...{02}{00}
#1472 This area is off-limits to{03}all those without a permit.{03}     {18}Lord McCoy{02}{00}
#1473 It's so quiet...{02}{00}
#1474 What is the matter, {11}{03}?{02}{00}
#1475 This tree...was a person.{02}{00}
#1476 Everyone in Kolima has{03}been turned into a tree.{02}{00}
#1477 It's horrible! All these{03}trees with clothes are{03}really Kolima's villagers!{02}{00}
#1478 Why? Do you know{03}why this happened?{1E}{00}
#1479 I see...{05} It was{03}because they hurt{03}the holy tree?{02}{00}
#147A I see...{03}Who could have known?{02}{00}
#147B What is it now, {11}{03}?{02}{00}
#147C That sparkly stuff{03}on the ground...{03}What is it?{02}{00}
#147D {09}{04}Aaah!{05} What's happening!?{02}{00}
#147E {09}{04}My mind!!!{03}Someone{05} is attacking my{18}{02}{00}
#147F {09}{04}I...{05} I can't...{03}I can't even stand up!{02}{00}
#1480 What is that?{05}{03}Something's falling from{03}the sky!{02}{00}
#1481 It's sparkling!{05}{05}{03}Could this be{05} what turned{03}those people into...{02}{00}
#1482 We've got to get{03}out of here!{02}{00}
#1483 I can't!{05} I can't move!!{02}{00}
#1484 Oh, no...{05}{03}If it touches us,{03}we'll turn into trees!{02}{00}
#1485 {11}{01}... What just{03}happened to us?{01}That barrier...{03}Did it save us?{1E}{00}
#1486 I think so, too, {11}{01}.{01}I think I know what{03}those domes were...{02}{00}
#1487 No, I think {11}{02}{03}is right.{01}I think I know what{03}those domes were...{02}{00}
#1488 You know what{03}those fields were?{02}{00}
#1489 It was our Psynergy.{02}{00}
#148A What are you, crazy?{02}{00}
#148B I didn't use{03}any Psynergy!{02}{00}
#148C Hey...{05}{05} I can stand...{05}{03}I can move again!{02}{00}
#148D You're right.{03}I can stand, too...{02}{00}
#148E {11}{03}, it's okay!{03}Go ahead!{05} Stand up!{02}{00}
#148F Those barriers...{02}{00}
#1490 We thought that{05} Psynergy{03}was only used when we{03}concentrate, right?{1E}{00}
#1491 You're such a liar, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#1492 When I was training, I'd{03}focus so hard, I thought{03}my head would burst.{02}{00}
#1493 Well, maybe it's just{03}easier for you, but{03}when I use Psynergy...{02}{00}
#1494 But what? The only way{03}you can use Psynergy is{03}by concentrating!{02}{00}
#1495 Anyway, I'm certain that{03}was Psynergy we{03}were projecting.{02}{00}
#1496 That must mean that{03}some Psynergy acts only{03}when it's needed.{02}{00}
#1497 You mean, like when{03}we're in danger?{02}{00}
#1498 I think it's like{03}when we strike critical{03}hits in battle.{01}We can't control it,{03}but it's there when{03}we need it.{02}{00}
#1499 I can agree with what{03}{11}{02} is saying. It is{03}definitely possible...{02}{00}
#149A Wouldn't it be something{03}if we could use this{03}power at any time, {11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#149B Yeah! Let's start{03}trying to master{03}this power!{02}{00}
#149C You...{05}{05}{03}You're not really into{03}this, are you?{02}{00}
#149D Watch out!{03}It's happening again!{02}{00}
#149E Hroom!{05} Why?{05}{05} Why don't{03}they turn into trees...?{02}{00}
#149F Who are they?{02}{00}
#14A0 What people are these,{03}who are immune to{03}Tret's glamour?{02}{00}
#14A1 Have they come to save{03}that village with{03}their strange powers?{02}{00}
#14A2 It will not be enough{05}{03}to save the people{03}of Kolima.{02}{00}
#14A3 They have earned{03}their fate...{01}Kolima took their axes{03}to me, and now I shall{03}take mine to them!{02}{00}
#14A4 You children may not know{03}this...but we are{05} dying.{02}{00}
#14A5 And Kolima Forest will{03}wither and die when{03}we are gone.{02}{00}
#14A6 We are not the only ones{03}who will die, Laurel.{01}Once we are gone,{03}they, too, will go!{02}{00}
#14A7 Tret was once a kindly{03}forest king.{02}{00}
#14A8 But he is slowly dying,{03}and his heart has{03}torn in two...{02}{00}
#14A9 His wrathful side turned{03}the people of Kolima{03}into trees.{02}{00}
#14AA The kind Tret{03}speaks no more.{02}{00}
#14AB Hroom!{05} The kindly heart{03}invites destruction...{05}{05}{03}I need no kindness!{02}{00}
#14AC If you wish to save{03}those whom Tret turned{03}into trees,{01}you must reawaken{03}his gentle side.{02}{00}
#14AD But...{05}if you cannot{03}stop Tret from withering,{03}we all will...{02}{00}
#14AE Look for Tret deep{03}within the forest.{02}{00}
#14AF It's no use, Laurel.{05}{03}Humans cannot be trusted!{01}I shall die...{05}and the{03}rest of the forest{03}will die with me!{02}{00}
#14B0 {11}{01}...{05}{03}Isn't there anything{03}we can do?{1E}{00}
#14B1 What can we do?{05}{03}Do you have any idea?{1E}{00}
#14B2 It looks like {11}{01} has{03}something in mind.{02}{00}
#14B3 We'll leave it up to{03}you, {11}{01}.{03}Let's go save everyone.{02}{00}
#14B4 He's as stumped as we{03}are{05}, but he says he'll{03}help...{02}{00}
#14B5 I trust {11}{01}.{05}{03}He'll come up with{03}an idea.{02}{00}
#14B6 You're right, {11}{01}...{03}There isn't much we can{03}do now.{02}{00}
#14B7 So{05} the people of Kolima{03}will just remain trees{03}until they wither and die?{1E}{00}
#14B8 I'm disappointed in you,{03}{11}{01}...{05} How can you{03}give up so easily?{02}{00}
#14B9 That's right...{03}We can't just leave{03}them to rot!{02}{00}
#14BA But{05} how can we bring{03}back the nice Tret and{03}save the village?{02}{00}
#14BB I guess I really don't{03}know what to do.{02}{00}
#14BC {11}{03}, you can't give{03}up!{05} Please,{05} convince him{03}to help!{02}{00}
#14BD Just promise me this{03}one thing...{02}{00}
#14BE Promise{05} you will do{03}everything in your power{03}to save Kolima.{02}{00}
#14BF That's a relief, {11}{01}.{05}{03}I thought you'd given up{03}on Kolima altogether.{02}{00}
#14C0 I was beginning to lose{03}faith in you, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#14C1 But what can we do?{05}{03}How can we bring{03}back the good Tret{01}and save Kolima?{02}{00}
#14C2 I really don't have any{03}idea right now...{02}{00}
#14C3 I'm not sure...{03}What should we do?{02}{00}
#14C4 I don't know just yet...{03}But I'm sure we'll think{03}of something.{02}{00}
#14C5 Well,{05} let's get on{03}with it!{02}{00}
#14C6 It's you...{05} Soon, we will{03}all wither with Tret.{01}You will not be{03}safe in the forest.{03}You must leave now.{02}{00}
#14C7 Leave now...{03}before this forest{03}dies.{02}{00}
#14C8 The healing waters of{03}Mercury Lighthouse{03}might save Tret...{01}But the fountain's{03}waters have long since{03}dried up...{02}{00}
#14C9 .{05}.{05}.{05}{02}{00}
#14CA Hroooom! He will not{03}speak to you, child!{02}{00}
#14CB I control all in{03}Tret's realm!{02}{00}
#14CC I control Tret's heart!{03}I shall not let you{03}do anything to him!{02}{00}
#14CD Tret, the forest, and the{03}village of Kolima all{03}shall wither with me!{02}{00}
#14CE Hm{05} HROOOM!!!{02}{00}
#14CF You!{03}You hoped to find{03}my kindly self?{02}{00}
#14D0 Fools!{05}{01}You should never have{03}come here, and now,{03}you shall never leave!{02}{00}
#14D1 Your powers protected{03}you in the forest,{01}but now you are in the{03}heart of my power!{02}{00}
#14D2 Here, you will all become{03}trees, and you'll wither{03}with the rest of us!{02}{00}
#14D3 Oh...{05} Mmmmm...{02}{00}
#14D4 What has happened{03}to me?{02}{00}
#14D5 Was I...{05} I see...{05}{03}My heart was all{03}but lost in my rage.{02}{00}
#14D6 And you{05} defeated{03}the evil within me?{02}{00}
#14D7 I thank you.{05} I could not{03}leave this world with{03}so much evil in my heart.{02}{00}
#14D8 I am free now to leave{03}the world without regret.{05}{03}Good-bye, great warriors.{02}{00}
#14D9 Hey! Wait a minute!{03}We can't let Tret{03}die like this!{02}{00}
#14DA That's right, {11}{01}.{03}We still need his help!!{02}{00}
#14DB .{05}.{05}.{05}What?{02}{00}
#14DC Why have you not left{03}me to my dying?{03}Do you need something?{1E}{00}
#14DD What are you doing,{03}{11}{01}! Now's not the{03}time to fool around!{02}{00}
#14DE That's right, {11}{01}...{05}{01}We have to save{03}everyone in Kolima!{02}{00}
#14DF I{05} turned the people{03}of Kolima into trees?{02}{00}
#14E0 Hroom! I must release{03}them before they die{03}with the forest!{02}{00}
#14E1 I can't do it...{05} My power{03}no longer reaches{03}Kolima...{02}{00}
#14E2 People of Kolima...{03}Forgive me...{02}{00}
#14E3 Tret's too weak! He{03}doesn't have the power to{03}save Kolima.{02}{00}
#14E4 No! We have{03}to heal him!{01}We can't let the{03}people of Kolima die{03}with the forest!{02}{00}
#14E5 Every life in Kolima{03}depends on us!{02}{00}
#14E6 We have to restore Tret{03}and save the people{03}of Kolima!{02}{00}
#14E7 Let's go, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#14E8 Let's try the water!{02}{00}
#14E9 Surely that will{03}revive Tret!{02}{00}
#14EA Hurry, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#14EB .{05}.{05}.{05}{02}{00}
#14EC People of Kolima...{03}Forgive me...{02}{00}
#14ED The Water of Hermes{03}seeped into Tret.{02}{00}
#14EE I feel a great power{03}spreading through me...{02}{00}
#14EF Hroooom...{05} Life flows{03}within me once again.{02}{00}
#14F0 Tret...{02}{00}
#14F1 As you have recovered,{03}so has our forest...{02}{00}
#14F2 I am sorry to have{03}worried you so, Laurel.{02}{00}
#14F3 And you, young ones...{03}Didn't you have a{03}favor to ask of me?{1E}{00}
#14F4 Yes, Tret...{05} You must turn{03}the people of Kolima{03}into humans again.{02}{00}
#14F5 Yes, that's right...{03}I must hurry.{02}{00}
#14F6 {11}{01}! Did you forget?{03}We need to save{03}the people of Kolima!{02}{00}
#14F7 Tret should be able to do{03}it, now that his energy{03}has returned.{02}{00}
#14F8 Ask him to save{03}everyone he turned{03}into a tree!{02}{00}
#14F9 Please, Tret... You have{03}to save those whom{03}you turned into trees.{02}{00}
#14FA That's right...{03}I must hurry.{02}{00}
#14FB That should do it.{05}{03}The people of Kolima are{03}cursed no more.{02}{00}
#14FC Tret did not always{03}possess this horrible{03}power.{02}{00}
#14FD It only started when{03}those strange gemstones{03}fell from the sky.{02}{00}
#14FE Gems from the sky...{03}Do you think he means{03}the Psynergy Stones?{1E}{00}
#14FF You really think{03}Psynergy Stones caused{03}all of this trouble?{02}{00}
#1500 I know you don't want{03}to believe it, but{03}nothing else makes sense...{02}{00}
#1501 I was indeed angry that{03}people had laid waste{03}to my forest...{01}They had even taken{03}their axes to me!{02}{00}
#1502 Then those gems fell{03}into my branches...{02}{00}
#1503 Then all of a sudden...{03}my fury overwhelmed me,{03}and I was lost in anger!{02}{00}
#1504 The gem reached me{03}when I was filled{03}with sorrow...{02}{00}
#1505 Our actions spoke our{03}hearts' desires, but we{03}had no idea...{02}{00}
#1506 Those gems twisted my{03}anger into a force{03}beyond my control.{02}{00}
#1507 Have any of the saplings{03}been transformed by those{03}stones, Tret?{02}{00}
#1508 No... Only the elder trees{03}were affected by the{03}falling Psynergy Stones.{02}{00}
#1509 There are others that{03}this happened to?{02}{00}
#150A So the same thing could{03}be happening elsewhere!{02}{00}
#150B You must have fought{03}many monsters on your{03}way here.{02}{00}
#150C Those monsters...{03}Maybe they were just{03}animals that were...{02}{00}
#150D Once, they were pure{03}of heart... Hroom...{01}Those gems have brought{03}a great evil to{03}the world...{02}{00}
#150E Oh! Laurel, you were{03}given powers, too?{02}{00}
#150F Different from my own,{03}but stemming from{03}the same source.{02}{00}
#1510 Laurel! What in the world{03}are you doing?{02}{00}
#1511 Wait. You will soon see.{02}{00}
#1512 What did you see, Laurel?{02}{00}
#1513 It's true{18}even the{03}animals have become{03}monsters.{01}And beyond the river...{02}{00}
#1514 The river that{03}feeds our forest?{02}{00}
#1515 Yes... An evil forest{03}has risen up to the{03}south of the river.{02}{00}
#1516 Will you be heading{03}south across the river?{1E}{00}
#1517 That area will only{03}grow more dangerous as{03}time passes...{01}If you must go, you'd{03}better hurry.{02}{00}
#1518 That's good... It would{03}be foolish to risk{03}your lives further.{02}{00}
#1519 I owe you a great debt.{03}You have saved Kolima,{03}the forest, and me.{02}{00}
#151A May your roots dig{03}deep and your branches{03}reach high.{02}{00}
#151B Were you surprised,{03}{11}{01}? We trees have{03}grown quite powerful.{02}{00}
#151C Now that I have such{03}power, no axe shall ever{03}touch me again.{01}You may depart{03}with no worries.{02}{00}
#151D The forest of Kolima{03}is alive once again,{03}thanks to you...{01}We shall protect the{03}forest from now on.{02}{00}
#151E I know that I cannot stop{03}you, but please be{03}careful beyond the river.{02}{00}
#151F It must be horrible{03}beyond the river...{01}I am so worried about{03}you and your friends,{03}{11}{01}.{02}{00}
#1520 Who are you...?{02}{00}
#1521 Oh!{05} You are the ones who{03}resisted Tret's glamour?{02}{00}
#1522 I sense a great warmth{03}within you...{02}{00}
#1523 If you came to rescue{03}Tret, you are already{03}too late. {02}{00}
#1524 Soon, Tret will die,{03}and we shall wither{03}away without him.{01}Leave now, before this{03}forest is destroyed...{02}{00}
#1525 Leave now, before this{03}forest is destroyed...{02}{00}
#1526 "Do not touch{03}Floodgate Switch!"{02}{00}
#1527 The sign reads: "You{03}can't read this sign{03}from the back!"{02}{00}
#1528 {10} flipped{03}the switch.{02}{00}
#1529 {09}{04}Brrrrr...{03}Ah-choo!!!{05} I'm freezing!{01}Is {11}{04} here yet?{02}{00}
#152A Hi! Are you new in Imil?{1E}{00}
#152B I should warn you,{03}there's a bad cold going{03}around right now.{01}Try not to catch it.{02}{00}
#152C You don't look familiar.{03}Are you sure you're{03}not...fibbing?{02}{00}
#152D One,{05} two,{05} three{05}, four! {02}{00}
#152E I tend to stay indoors{03}a lot when the weather{03}turns cold.{01}It's not good for your{03}health, though, so I{03}try to work out.{02}{00}
#152F {09}{04}{11}{04} should be here{03}by now! Where is she?{02}{00}
#1530 We've had a lot of{03}strangers lately.{01}I wonder if they're going{03}to Mercury Lighthouse,{03}too...{02}{00}
#1531 People get sick because{03}they stay indoors all day,{03}hiding from the cold.{01}You have to keep in{03}shape if you don't want{03}to get sick!{02}{00}
#1532 There's been an{03}epidemic going{03}around Imil.{01}You should leave right{03}away if you don't want{03}to catch it.{02}{00}
#1533 {11}{04} is running around{03}town, caring for the sick.{01}I just don't want to{03}be any more trouble{03}to her.{02}{00}
#1534 {09}{04}Oooh...{05} Help me...{02}{00}
#1535 Grandpa!{05} Grandpa!{03}Hold on!{02}{00}
#1536 Oh, no!{05} This is terrible!{02}{00}
#1537 Get {11}{04}...{05}{03}Please, get {11}{04}!{02}{00}
#1538 {09}{04}It hurts...{02}{00}
#1539 Get {11}{04}... Hurry!{02}{00}
#153A {09}{04}Oooh...{05}{05} I don't feel so{03}good{05}... Am I going to die?{02}{00}
#153B He's always exaggerating{03}things, but I don't think{03}he's exaggerating now.{02}{00}
#153C {09}{04}Cough...{05}{07}{03}The epidemic has hit{03}almost everyone in Imil.{01}I'm sick, too. {09}{04}Cough!{07}{01}What would happen to us{03}if we didn't have {11}{04}?{03}{09}{04}Cough{07}!{02}{00}
#153D Her palms shine with{03}a blue light...{03}Could she be{05} an angel?{02}{00}
#153E Our store is closed{03}until we get well...{02}{00}
#153F Do you want weapons?{1E}{00}
#1540 I can't sell weapons{03}until I am cured. {09}{04}Ohh...{05}{07}{03}I'm getting chills... {09}{04}Cough!{07}{02}{00}
#1541 It's the travelers from{03}down south who brought{03}disease to our village...{01}{07}Are you from down south,{03}too? If you have no{03}business here,{01}then begone... {09}{04}Cough!{07}{02}{00}
#1542 Who are these people?{03}They must be strong folk{03}to come to Imil in winter.{02}{00}
#1543 Sorry, but I'm too sick{03}to do business today.{03}Try again tomorrow...{02}{00}
#1544 We're closed!!!{03}Sorry... I get a little{03}cranky when I'm sick. {01}I'll open up the shop{03}when I get better.{02}{00}
#1545 Why do they always{03}come when I'm sick?{02}{00}
#1546 Mom's sick, but I can{03}get you whatever you{03}need...{02}{00}
#1547 My dad is a lumberjack.{03}He's down south working{03}in Kolima.{02}{00}
#1548 If you want to buy{03}anything, please talk to{03}my daughter.{02}{00}
#1549 I wonder if they are{03}headed to Mercury{03}Lighthouse, too.{01}They'll never make{03}it without {11}{04}.{02}{00}
#154A If only we had some of{03}that mythical springwater.{03}That'd fix us right up!{02}{00}
#154B Why have two groups of{03}travelers come through{03}such heavy snows to Imil?{01}The first group has{03}already gone off{03}somewhere.{02}{00}
#154C We're the only inn that{03}stays open in winter,{03}since guests are so few.{01}We'll wait on you hand{03}and foot, so please{03}stay a while!{02}{00}
#154D Do you want to see{03}the restaurant menu?{1E}{00}
#154E Here you go.{05} We're a{03}small town, mind you, so{03}the selection isn't great.{02}{00}
#154F Tonight's dinner is stew{03}and rye bread. Sounds{03}like quite a feast,{05} huh?{02}{00}
#1550 So many customers!{03}It just goes to show you,{01}good things happen{03}if you work hard!{02}{00}
#1551 Winters are tough here,{03}so I'm glad to have{03}guests to talk to.{01}I'm going to give{03}them the best service{03}I can!{02}{00}
#1552 We don't get to eat{03}many fancy meals in{03}the winter.{01}A tasty stew would{03}be a real treat!{02}{00}
#1553 I may only be a student,{03}but I can act as your{03}healer.{02}{00}
#1554 Are you looking for {11}{04}?{1E}{00}
#1555 {11}{04} just left.{01}An epidemic is sweeping{03}the village, so {11}{04} is{03}very busy.{02}{00}
#1556 {11}{04} is a very kind{03}healer.{01}I am just her apprentice.{03}I'm learning the arts{03}of healing from her.{02}{00}
#1557 Have you visited the{03}old couple who live near{03}the entrance of town?{1E}{00}
#1558 Oh. {05} That's too bad.{03}That's where {11}{04}{03}was headed.{01}You probably just missed{03}her if you didn't see her{03}along the way.{02}{00}
#1559 {11}{04} went to their house.{03}You might have seen her{03}if you stopped there...{02}{00}
#155A These folk are okay!{03}They don't seem like{03}bad people.{02}{00}
#155B {11}{04} was saying she has{03}a bad feeling about{03}something.{01}Could she have meant{03}these people?{02}{00}
#155C How are you feeling?{02}{00}
#155D {09}{04} Cough...{05} Cough...{02}{00}
#155E He's been coughing for{03}quite a while,{03}now...{02}{00}
#155F You'll feel better soon.{02}{00}
#1560 {09}{04}Cough{05} cough...{05}{05}{03}Cough{05}{05}... {05}{05}{03}Cough... {05}{05}{05}Cough...{02}{00}
#1561 How do you feel now?{02}{00}
#1562 Much{05} better...{02}{00}
#1563 No, Grandpa.{05} You mustn't{03}push yourself too hard!{02}{00}
#1564 Thank you, {11}{04}...{01}I can't imagine how{03}this village would ever{03}manage without you...{01}{09}{04}Cough{07}...{02}{00}
#1565 Don't mention it...{03}You should rest{03}in bed, too, ma'am.{02}{00}
#1566 Who are you?{02}{00}
#1567 Can I help you?{02}{00}
#1568 Was that{05}{05}{05} the lighthouse?{02}{00}
#1569 It can't be...{02}{00}
#156A Only I can...{02}{00}
#156B Oh, no...{05} Alex!!!{02}{00}
#156C I feel much better,{03}thanks to {11}{04}.{03}I should be fine now.{02}{00}
#156D What happened in the{03}lighthouse to the{03}northeast?{02}{00}
#156E {11}{04} is a good girl.{03}I wish I had a{03}daughter like her.{01}It's a shame her last{03}apprentice, Alex,{03}disappeared...{01}leaving her all alone.{02}{00}
#156F {11}{04}'s clan once lived{03}here and guarded the{03}lighthouse to the east.{01}Now, she's all alone.{02}{00}
#1570 Even if {11}{04} heals us, this{03}epidemic will just come{03}back next year. {09}{04}Brr...{02}{00}
#1571 I can't understand why{03}any one would exercise{03}in this cold weather.{02}{00}
#1572 I am the healer while{03}{11}{04} is out, so tell me{03}if you need anything.{02}{00}
#1573 I feel like a grown-up{03}when I am serving as{03}a healer. It feels great.{02}{00}
#1574 Everyone counts on {11}{04}.{03}That's why she is always{03}so busy.{02}{00}
#1575 We have to do whatever{03}we can to help {11}{04}.{03}She's way too busy.{02}{00}
#1576 Fountain of Healing{01}Water of Hermes:{03}It brings rejuvenation{03}to all that lives.{02}{00}
#1577 Somebody...is here.{02}{00}
#1578 Someone is here...{02}{00}
#1579 Can you hear it, too?{1E}{00}
#157A Alex is the only one{03}other than I who can{03}enter Mercury Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#157B You can't hear it? Well,{03}I can. {01}Alex is the only one{03}other than I who can{03}enter Mercury Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#157C But this statue is{03}blocking my way...{02}{00}
#157D This statue is blocking{03}the entrance.{02}{00}
#157E Someone doesn't want{03}me to get inside.{02}{00}
#157F Did you do that?{1E}{00}
#1580 No, I saw it!{03}I'm certain that flow of{03}force came from you.{02}{00}
#1581 I knew it...{03}I saw a ghostly{03}force pushing it!{02}{00}
#1582 You{05}...{05} You could{03}see our Psynergy?{02}{00}
#1583 Psynergy... Is that what{03}you call that power?{02}{00}
#1584 We had thought you were{03}using Psynergy when you{03}healed that old man, {11}{04}.{02}{00}
#1585 That's a special power,{03}handed down to members{03}of the Mercury Clan{01}from generation{03}to generation.{02}{00}
#1586 It is called Ply,{03}a power generated{03}through meditation.{02}{00}
#1587 It was once{03}much stronger...{02}{00}
#1588 This Mercury Clan{03}sounds a little like people{03}of Vale, don't you think?{1E}{00}
#1589 Sure... They're the sworn{03}protectors of a special{03}power, just like us!{02}{00}
#158A Oh, come on! Both of{03}them are protectors of{03}special powers!{01}It's just the names{03}that are different!{02}{00}
#158B I have to go...{03}I have to find whoever{03}entered the lighthouse.{02}{00}
#158C {11}{04} used Ply.{02}{00}
#158D A monster inside{03}Mercury Lighthouse?{03}How could this be!?{02}{00}
#158E I have to get{03}past him!{02}{00}
#158F The path is blocked again.{05}{03}What am I going to do?{02}{00}
#1590 This statue wasn't{03}here before. I wonder{03}if Alex...{01}No, Alex wouldn't do{03}that...but what if he's{03}not alone?{02}{00}
#1591 You've saved me again,{03}haven't you!{02}{00}
#1592 Do you have business{03}in the lighthouse, too?{1E}{00}
#1593 Please tell me{03}the truth!{02}{00}
#1594 I can't believe you'd{03}go so far to help{03}someone you just met.{02}{00}
#1595 You have some errand{03}in this lighthouse,{03}don't you?{1E}{00}
#1596 Please tell me{03}the truth!{1E}{00}
#1597 I thought so...{02}{00}
#1598 I am sure there will{03}be more places ahead that{03}I cannot pass alone.{02}{00}
#1599 Only those of the Mercury{03}Clan are permitted to{03}enter this place.{02}{00}
#159A However, I sense{03}something special about{03}you.{01}I feel that I{03}can trust you!{02}{00}
#159B The Adept {11}{04} joined{03}your party!{02}{00}
#159C It's too late! The{03}lighthouse has already{03}been lit!{02}{00}
#159D It...{05} It can't be!{02}{00}
#159E The beacon cannot be{03}lit without the{03}Mercury Star...{02}{00}
#159F ...The Elemental Stars{03}were stolen from Sol{03}Sanctum, on Mt. Aleph.{02}{00}
#15A0 Mt. Aleph... Sol Sanctum...{05}{03}Are you healers from{03}Sol Sanctum?{1E}{00}
#15A1 We came from a village{03}called Vale to recover{03}the three Elemental Stars.{02}{00}
#15A2 But, unlike you, we are{03}not healers.{02}{00}
#15A3 We came from Mt. Aleph,{03}but we're not healers.{02}{00}
#15A4 We came from a village{03}called Vale to recover{03}the three Elemental Stars.{02}{00}
#15A5 Did you say{05} Vale?{02}{00}
#15A6 Our village was there to{03}protect Sol Sanctum, but{03}the Stars were stolen.{02}{00}
#15A7 That sounds just like{03}my clan...{02}{00}
#15A8 I have failed in the{03}one duty placed upon me...{05}{01}This is terrible.{02}{00}
#15A9 {11}{01}! {11}{02}!{02}{00}
#15AA So it's you, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#15AB Heh heh! Those kids are{03}still alive?{02}{00}
#15AC You came all this way to{03}save {11}{06} and Kraden?{02}{00}
#15AD That's not all...{03}We're after the{03}Elemental Stars!{02}{00}
#15AE In other words,{05} they've{03}come to stop us.{02}{00}
#15AF Then we have no choice...{01}Let's take care of{03}them now, before they{03}can do any harm!{02}{00}
#15B0 Menardi... {05}Wait!{02}{00}
#15B1 Oh, Saturos...{03}They want to...{02}{00}
#15B2 I heard everything.{02}{00}
#15B3 They were lucky to{03}survive the eruption of{03}Mt. Aleph.{02}{00}
#15B4 You have endured so{03}much, and now you want{03}to throw your lives away?{02}{00}
#15B5 Fine. If that is your{03}wish, prepare to have{03}it granted.{02}{00}
#15B6 Saturos... Are you going{03}to fight them alone?{02}{00}
#15B7 Menardi, I can't expect{03}you to leave our hostages{03}alone and help me, can I?{02}{00}
#15B8 Umm...{05} That's true...{02}{00}
#15B9 Besides, I want to{03}see how much their{03}powers have developed.{02}{00}
#15BA Are you sure about this,{03}Saturos?{02}{00}
#15BB Leave me be!{05} Head for the{03}next lighthouse{18}now!{02}{00}
#15BC Come here, child...{02}{00}
#15BD Do you mean to{03}defy me?{02}{00}
#15BE I should teach you a{03}lesson, child, but...{02}{00}
#15BF {11}{05}, I'd get your sister{03}to obey me, if you hope{03}to keep her from harm.{02}{00}
#15C0 {11}{06}{05}, please...{03}Just do as she says{03}for now.{02}{00}
#15C1 {11}{05}{05}.{05}.{05}.{02}{00}
#15C2 It's all right, {11}{06}.{02}{00}
#15C3 {11}{01} and {11}{02}{03}shouldn't have come after{03}us...{02}{00}
#15C4 I'm sorry, {11}{01},{03}{11}{02}...{02}{00}
#15C5 I'm counting on you!{02}{00}
#15C6 {11}{01}! {11}{02}!{03}Don't{05} die!{02}{00}
#15C7 {11}{06}... {03}Kraden!{02}{00}
#15C8 If you want to save{03}them, you'll have to{03}beat me, first!{02}{00}
#15C9 No! Get back!{02}{00}
#15CA What's the matter!{02}{00}
#15CB Saturos is extremely{03}powerful. I could sense{03}it when I faced him.{02}{00}
#15CC You have to be very{03}careful when fighting him...{01}We have to match{03}his strength...{02}{00}
#15CD Match me?{05} Pah! You{03}think you can match{03}the great Saturos?{1E}{00}
#15CE You overestimate{03}your chances.{02}{00}
#15CF And yet you still want{03}to fight? Ship of fools...{02}{00}
#15D0 Fine then... I'll just{03}teach you all a lesson!{02}{00}
#15D1 What happened? Saturos{03}is moving strangely.{02}{00}
#15D2 What's this!? The light of{03}Mercury... It's{03}weakening my Psynergy!{02}{00}
#15D3 I must finish this{03}quickly... Come on, fools!{02}{00}
#15D4 {11}{01}, we got him!{02}{00}
#15D5 Who would have thought{03}that Mercury Lighthouse{03}held such great power?{01}If only my Psynergy had{03}been at its full power...{02}{00}
#15D6 Saturos... You said{03}you were weakened.{03}What did you mean?{02}{00}
#15D7 I{05}.{05}.{05}.{05} I meant nothing...{02}{00}
#15D8 I shall tell you{03}what he means...{02}{00}
#15D9 That voice! Could it be?{02}{00}
#15DA Alex!{02}{00}
#15DB It's been a while, {11}{04}.{02}{00}
#15DC Alex, do you realize{03}what you've done?{02}{00}
#15DD Ha! Of course... I have{03}freed a great power that{03}has long been sealed away.{02}{00}
#15DE Mercury, the lighthouse{03}of Water...{03}What a mighty force.{02}{00}
#15DF Alex, you...{03}Are you mad!?{02}{00}
#15E0 No, {11}{04}...{03}Don't you understand?{02}{00}
#15E1 The lighthouse granted{03}you great power during{03}your battle with Saturos.{02}{00}
#15E2 It's true...{03}I could use my power{03}without ever depleting it.{02}{00}
#15E3 Don't you see?{01}The Mercury Lighthouse{03}supplied you with{03}limitless Psynergy.{02}{00}
#15E4 Psynergy? Are you telling{03}me my powers come{03}from Psynergy?{02}{00}
#15E5 You and I are both{03}members of Mercury{03}Clan...{01}Masters of Water{03}Psynergy.{02}{00}
#15E6 {11}{04} is an Adept{03}too, isn't she?{1E}{00}
#15E7 Geez, {11}{01}, you knew{03}all along, and you{03}didn't tell us?{02}{00}
#15E8 I know it's hard to{03}believe, but it looks like{03}{11}{04}'s one of us.{02}{00}
#15E9 Tell me, Alex...{03}Why wasn't Saturos able{03}to use his full power?{02}{00}
#15EA Ah, yes...{03}I shall explain it all.{02}{00}
#15EB Saturos is aligned with{03}Mars, the clan of fire.{02}{00}
#15EC Fire and water are{03}opposing elements...{01}His full power was bound{03}by the Water Psynergy{03}of the lighthouse.{02}{00}
#15ED Didn't Saturos{03}know that?{02}{00}
#15EE Of course he knew.{02}{00}
#15EF However, he failed to{03}appreciate the power{03}of this lighthouse.{02}{00}
#15F0 As did I...{02}{00}
#15F1 Is that why we were{03}able to defeat Saturos?{02}{00}
#15F2 No...{03}There is more to it.{02}{00}
#15F3 I stood by, watching your{03}battle from afar...{02}{00}
#15F4 You were watching us?{02}{00}
#15F5 Yes. I did not help{03}Saturos, because I was{03}certain he would win.{02}{00}
#15F6 But I was wrong... You{03}have become such great{03}fighters in a short time.{02}{00}
#15F7 Saturos is up again!?{03}But we beat him!{02}{00}
#15F8 Me? Beaten? Never!{03}I lost to this lighthouse,{03}not to you!{02}{00}
#15F9 I was merely stalling you{03}until Saturos regained{03}his strength.{02}{00}
#15FA You were just buying{03}time! That's not fair,{03}Alex!{02}{00}
#15FB I won't let Saturos{03}escape!{02}{00}
#15FC And just what are you{03}going to do? Will you{05}{03}finish him off?{1E}{00}
#15FD If that's the case,{03}you will have to fight{03}me, as well.{01}I've seen how you fight.{03}You cannot hope to win.{02}{00}
#15FE Yes, {11}{01}. You seem{03}like a smart warrior.{01}You can't beat our{03}combined might, now that{03}we've seen how you fight.{02}{00}
#15FF And I doubt you are{03}the type to 'finish'{03}anyone off!{02}{00}
#1600 Of course, you are{03}welcome to believe{03}whatever you want.{02}{00}
#1601 He warped again!{02}{00}
#1602 Again?{05}{03}He's done that before?{02}{00}
#1603 Yeah, in Sol Sanctum...{02}{00}
#1604 That Psynergy...the warp.{03}Does that mean {11}{04}{03}can use it?{02}{00}
#1605 No, it's impossible.{03}Even Alex didn't have{03}this kind of power before.{02}{00}
#1606 Ah, well... I can't stay the{03}same Alex you knew{03}forever...{02}{00}
#1607 Well, it seems that my{03}ride has returned while{03}we were speaking.{02}{00}
#1608 And so, I bid you adieu.{02}{00}
#1609 {11}{01}, Saturos{03}still has the{03}Elemental Stars!{02}{00}
#160A That's right!{03}We can't let them{03}leave now!{02}{00}
#160B Oh? And you want{03}to take the Elemental{03}Stars from Saturos?{1E}{00}
#160C Ha! Too bad!{03}Menardi has them. You'll{03}have to ask her!{02}{00}
#160D Ha! You're right...{03}Menardi has the{03}Elemental Stars!{02}{00}
#160E That reminds me...{02}{00}
#160F Do you still have{03}the Mars Star?{1E}{00}
#1610 I appreciate your{03}honesty.{02}{00}
#1611 Are you telling the truth?{03}Well, I shall believe you{03}for now.{02}{00}
#1612 I suppose you'll be willing{03}to pursue us for the{03}Elemental Stars?{1E}{00}
#1613 I look forward to it.{03}I shall see you{03}soon, then.{02}{00}
#1614 That's too bad...{03}I shall look forward to{03}seeing you again.{02}{00}
#1615 Good-bye.{02}{00}
#1616 I look forward to our{03}next battle.{02}{00}
#1617 They're gone...{02}{00}
#1618 Shoot... We couldn't even{03}save {11}{06}...{02}{00}
#1619 I don't deserve to{03}be a healer...{02}{00}
#161A We couldn't stop them{03}from lighting the{03}beacon.{02}{00}
#161B I've failed my clan,{03}failed in my duty...{02}{00}
#161C That's not true!{03}We can still beat{03}them, right, {11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#161D That's right, {11}{01}!{01}All we have to do is stop{03}them from lighting{03}all the lighthouses!{02}{00}
#161E You're not helping here!{01}We're fine as long as{03}the lighthouses aren't{03}all lit!{02}{00}
#161F The beacon of Mercury{03}Lighthouse has been lit,{01}but we'll stop{03}them next time.{02}{00}
#1620 That's right. We can{03}save {11}{06} at the{03}next lighthouse.{02}{00}
#1621 Yes. We won't let Alex{03}get away with this...{02}{00}
#1622 Let's go after{03}them now!{02}{00}
#1623 What's the matter?{03}We should hurry!{02}{00}
#1624 We?{03}{11}{04}, are you{03}coming along with us?{02}{00}
#1625 But the people of Imil{03}need you, {11}{04}.{02}{00}
#1626 It's okay.{02}{00}
#1627 "The fountain shall be{03}filled as long as light{03}fills the lighthouse."{01}That's an old saying.{03}The fountain will run over{03}with healing waters now.{02}{00}
#1628 I have mixed feelings{03}about leaving, but Imil will{03}be fine as long as{01}the fountain continues{03}to flow with the{03}Water of Hermes.{02}{00}
#1629 We should hurry if we're{03}going to follow them.{02}{00}
#162A The legends said that if{03}the lighthouse was lit, the{03}fountain would fill again!{01}It looks like the{03}legends were true!{02}{00}
#162B Our fountain is back! They{03}say these waters can{03}heal all that lives.{02}{00}
#162C I drank the healing water,{03}and now I feel great!{01}I should get a bottle{03}so I can take some{03}home with me.{02}{00}
#162D We don't have to fear{03}any epidemic as long as{03}we have our fountain.{02}{00}
#162E How did the fountain{03}know that the beacon{03}was lit?{02}{00}
#162F All that lives... That means{03}it must work on plants and{03}animals, too.{02}{00}
#1630 I knew it would work, but{03}I never knew it would{03}work this well!{01}I feel ten years younger!{02}{00}
#1631 I never believed those{03}stories, but there's{03}the proof!{02}{00}
#1632 He who honors the heart{03}of the goddess shall stand{03}at the center of all,{01}like a swan in the{03}center of a rippling{03}pond.{02}{00}
#1633 He who honors the{03}goddess of rainbows shall{01}be guided to the heavens{03}upon wings of fluid grace.{02}{00}
#1634 The door is shut tight.{02}{00}
#1635 The fountain is flowing{03}with water.{02}{00}
#1636 The fountain seems dry.{02}{00}
#1637 Strange forces are at{03}work... It seems{03}impossible to proceed.{02}{00}
#1638 {12}{01} got{03}{14}{02}.{02}{00}
#1639 Please, don't hide{03}anything. Just tell{03}me the truth!{1E}{00}
#163A The Mercury Lighthouse{03}is shining.{01}{11}{04} will be leaving{03}us soon, won't she?{02}{00}
#163B Imil will be fine.{03}Disease is nothing to{03}the Water of Hermes.{02}{00}
#163C One,{05} two,{05} three,{05} four...{02}{00}
#163D I was training hard so{03}that I could withstand{03}any disease...{01}And now the lighthouse{03}fountain is back?{1E}{00}
#163E What did I train{03}so hard for all this time?{02}{00}
#163F No, it can't be! Everyone{03}is in perfect health!{02}{00}
#1640 {11}{04} was only in Imil{03}to guard the lighthouse.{01}Now that it's been lit,{03}she'll probably leave us.{02}{00}
#1641 Don't worry about us,{03}{11}{04}. We'll protect{03}the village now!{02}{00}
#1642 Now that I've let my{03}guard down, I'm getting{03}cold chills.{01}Maybe I should go{03}and drink some of{03}that fountain water.{02}{00}
#1643 That fountain water really{03}made Grandpa healthy.{02}{00}
#1644 Did I really say{03}I was going to die{03}from that disease?{1E}{00}
#1645 Ha ha ha! I must have{03}really felt sick to{03}say that!{01}I'm good for another 30{03}years!{05} ...Let me get{03}back to work!{02}{00}
#1646 That's right!{03}The strong old man of{03}Imil, that's me!{02}{00}
#1647 Grandpa's all better{03}now, thanks to that{03}fountain water.{02}{00}
#1648 Now, {11}{04} can leave{03}the village without any{03}worries.{02}{00}
#1649 It's nice that the fountain{03}can heal us, but {11}{04} had{03}something...special.{02}{00}
#164A That blue light from her{03}hands... Could she really{03}be an angel?{02}{00}
#164B I have to catch up{03}on lost opportunity!{03}It's time for business!{02}{00}
#164C Customers are hard to{03}come by, and I can't{03}afford to lose even one!{02}{00}
#164D It's a shame the store{03}was closed for something{03}as minor as a cold.{02}{00}
#164E The customers are back!{03}I thought I'd lost my{03}business for good.!{02}{00}
#164F I'm fully recovered,{03}thanks to the fountain!{03}I can get back to work!{02}{00}
#1650 I'm so happy that{03}Mommy is well again!{02}{00}
#1651 {11}{04} said it wouldn't be{03}good to leave the{03}lighthouse lit...{01}But it turned out to be{03}the best thing for Imil.{02}{00}
#1652 My daddy's still in Kolima.{03}I'll be really happy{03}if he comes home soon!{02}{00}
#1653 It's almost time for you{03}to leave, isn't it?{1E}{00}
#1654 Just like the legend said,{03}the fountain began flowing{03}when the light was lit.{01}That means that Imil{03}needs never fear{03}disease again!{02}{00}
#1655 Oh! I'll cook a feast{03}for you tonight!{02}{00}
#1656 Thank goodness the town{03}is back to normal again.{02}{00}
#1657 I'm glad the beacon has{03}been lit and the fountain{03}is flowing again.{01}But it's a shame that {11}{04}{03}is leaving the village...{02}{00}
#1658 {11}{04} will be{03}leaving with you all...{01}I wish you could{03}stay a little longer...{02}{00}
#1659 They came to our village{03}and now the fountain{03}is flowing.{01}They must truly be{03}our lucky charms.{02}{00}
#165A I never told {11}{04}{03}that I liked her...{01}But I guess it's for{03}the best.{02}{00}
#165B {11}{04}...{02}{00}
#165C We were worried that{03}you wouldn't come back!{02}{00}
#165D I'm so sorry,{03}you two...{02}{00}
#165E {11}{04}, we have a problem!{03}The Mercury Lighthouse...{03}It's been lit!{02}{00}
#165F {11}{04}, you already knew?{02}{00}
#1660 What's the matter?{05}{03}You look strange{03}today, {11}{04}.{02}{00}
#1661 I...{05}{03}How should I tell you?{02}{00}
#1662 You have something to{03}say? What is it?{02}{00}
#1663 Well, {05}I... Uh...{02}{00}
#1664 I...{05} I'll be joining{03}{11}{01} on his quest.{02}{00}
#1665 It's very hard for{03}me to leave you, but{05}{03}it's the lighthouse.{02}{00}
#1666 You said the world would{03}be in danger if the{03}lighthouse was lit, right?{02}{00}
#1667 Is that why you're{03}leaving? To protect the{03}world?{02}{00}
#1668 Yes.{05} That's right...{02}{00}
#1669 Then there's nothing{03}we can do...{02}{00}
#166A We won't try{03}to stop you, then.{01}After all, you are{03}trying to protect{03}the Mercury Clan.{02}{00}
#166B Yes.{05} I am...{02}{00}
#166C As members of the{03}Mercury Clan...we will{03}protect Imil ourselves.{01}So don't worry, OK?{02}{00}
#166D I will try hard and{03}learn to heal as well{03}as you, {11}{04}!{02}{00}
#166E OK, I'll leave the{03}village in your hands,{03}Megan, Justin...{02}{00}
#166F We can leave{03}without any worries, now.{02}{00}
#1670 I will be the healer,{03}because I know how, OK?{02}{00}
#1671 {11}{04}'s going on a{03}journey with you, right?{01}Sniff... It makes me sad,{03}but I'll try to be a{03}good healer.{02}{00}
#1672 I will be a kind girl,{03}like {11}{04}.{01}Come back sometime{03}and see me all grown up.{03}I want you to.{02}{00}
#1673 {11}{04}'s going to defend{03}the honor of the{03}Mercury Clan.{02}{00}
#1674 I'm sorry, {11}{04}, but{03}I can't stand to{03}see you go.{02}{00}
#1675 If I could speak, I'd{03}tell them this is Kolima,{03}village of lumberjacks!{02}{00}
#1676 How could anyone turn a{03}girl as beautiful as{03}me into a tree?{01}Actually, I'm pretty{03}cute for a tree.{02}{00}
#1677 This is a dream...{03}It has to be a dream...{02}{00}
#1678 Being unable to move{03}is so inconvenient.{02}{00}
#1679 I am old; I've lived{03}a full life. I don't{03}even mind being a tree.{01}I just feel bad for all{03}those kids who were{03}turned into trees.{02}{00}
#167A It's the sacred tree's{03}curse! Why did they{03}try to cut down Tret?{02}{00}
#167B The water at my feet...{03}{05}Huh?{05} Hey!{05} It's delicious!{02}{00}
#167C If I can't move,{03}then Mom can't make{03}me go to bed!{02}{00}
#167D What are they staring at?{03}They seem awfully{03}young...{01}They don't stand a{03}chance against Tret.{02}{00}
#167E I dreamt that a mighty{03}warrior with a thick{03}beard ended this curse.{01}I dream about him{03}a lot, actually...{02}{00}
#167F What will happen to my{03}treasure if I'm stuck as{03}a tree forever?{02}{00}
#1680 Soon, all of Kolima will{03}be nothing but forest...{02}{00}
#1681 I wonder what Father's{03}secret is...{02}{00}
#1682 Maybe we turned into{03}trees because of all the{03}trees we've cut down.{01}We were only doing{03}our jobs, though.{02}{00}
#1683 At least my father wasn't{03}the one who tried to cut{03}down the holy tree.{02}{00}
#1684 The holy tree of Kolima{03}has great powers, just{03}like Father said.{02}{00}
#1685 I used to carve{03}weapons out of wood.{03}Now I am wood.{01}Life's funny{03}like that.{02}{00}
#1686 Man... I'm stuck inside.{03}That means I can't even{03}become a tall tree.{02}{00}
#1687 No! I don't want to{03}be stuck as a tree{03}forever!{02}{00}
#1688 Maybe if I meditate{03}harder, I'll turn{03}back into a man...{01}Ngg{05} Ung!!{05} Ugagaga!!!{02}{00}
#1689 Who caused all this?{03}Someone must have tried{03}to cut down Tret!{02}{00}
#168A How am I supposed to{03}charge people for their{03}rooms if I'm a tree!?{02}{00}
#168B The villagers were right.{03}I never should have tried{03}to cut that tree down.{01}Now I'll never see{03}my family in Imil{03}again...{02}{00}
#168C If only I'd left town{03}a day earlier. But this{03}room was so comfy!{02}{00}
#168D This is Kolima,{03}village of lumberjacks!{03}I'll shout it out loud!{01}This{05} is{05} Ko{05}li{05}ma!{02}{00}
#168E We rely on the forests{03}so much, and yet we hurt{03}the sacred tree...{01}Maybe we can work{03}to restore harmony{03}in the forest now.{02}{00}
#168F You know, being a tree{03}gives you a lot of{03}time to think.{02}{00}
#1690 I turned into a tree right{03}when the sparkles fell{03}from the sky.{02}{00}
#1691 Don't blame the villagers{03}for being tempted by{03}McCoy's money...{01}Anyone would be tempted{03}by such a staggering sum.{02}{00}
#1692 Who would try to use{03}the holy tree to build{03}a palace, anyway?{02}{00}
#1693 I didn't mind being{03}a tree...{01}Water never tasted{03}so good!{02}{00}
#1694 Yawn... Trees are so...{03}sleepy...{02}{00}
#1695 For a while I thought I'd{03}never be able to say this,{03}but I have to say it!{01}I've been waiting all of{03}my life for this moment!{02}{00}
#1696 The forest trees are{03}alive, just as we are...{02}{00}
#1697 I wonder if I'd live{03}longer if I were still{03}a tree.{02}{00}
#1698 If those sparkles start{03}falling again, I'm heading{03}for the hills.{02}{00}
#1699 I've been poor all my life.{01}That's why it bothers me{03}that McCoy thinks money{03}can solve everything.{02}{00}
#169A It's not called the holy{03}tree for nothing.{01}We should have been{03}more respectful.{02}{00}
#169B If we were all trees,{03}there'd be no more wars.{05}{03}'Cause we'd be trees.{02}{00}
#169C Nobody yells at you when{03}you're a tree...{01}And nobody makes you go{03}to bed early, either.{02}{00}
#169D I heard that traveling{03}warriors from the Goma{03}Range saved the village.{01}The warriors are said to{03}be enormously huge and{03}very strong.{01}They supposedly defeated{03}Tret to remove the curse.{02}{00}
#169E Big, strong warriors{03}with great beards freed{03}Kolima from the curse.{01}If you see them, please{03}thank them for me.{02}{00}
#169F I don't really know,{03}but you should be able{03}to tell travelers.{02}{00}
#16A0 All warriors are big,{03}and all warriors have{03}huge beards.{02}{00}
#16A1 You saved Kolima? Wow!{03}That makes me want to{03}tell you a secret!{01}But I'm not gonna. It's{03}too good to give away!{02}{00}
#16A2 My husband seems to be{03}keeping a secret{03}from me.{02}{00}
#16A3 Daddy told me his secret.{02}{00}
#16A4 It's hidden deep in{03}the forest, but I can't{03}tell him that!{02}{00}
#16A5 I think he found something{03}valuable, but where{03}could he be hiding it?{02}{00}
#16A6 Still, telling me it's{03}outside the village{03}doesn't help much...{02}{00}
#16A7 I'm never going to{03}use an axe again.{02}{00}
#16A8 Dad, will you please{03}go back to being a{03}lumberjack?{02}{00}
#16A9 Dad! How are we going{03}to eat if you don't work?{02}{00}
#16AA People turned into trees{03}because of my axe. I will{03}never use an axe again.{02}{00}
#16AB Knowing my Dad, he'll{03}start working again once{03}he gets hungry.{02}{00}
#16AC How am I supposed to{03}grow up if I don't{03}eat?{01}If he's not gonna feed me,{03}I'm not gonna obey him!{02}{00}
#16AD Fuchin Temple is on the{03}other side of the river.{03}It's quite famous.{01}You should visit it if{03}you have any spare{03}time.{02}{00}
#16AE Fuchin Temple's Master{03}Nyunpa is said to be a{03}strange one...{02}{00}
#16AF The grand bridge across{03}the river is the{03}pride of Kolima.{02}{00}
#16B0 It's a shame we had to{03}cut down so many trees{03}to build that bridge.{02}{00}
#16B1 When I was a tree,{03}I learned to appreciate{03}the sun.{02}{00}
#16B2 It felt so good{03}when my leaves were{03}bathed in sunlight.{02}{00}
#16B3 I am told the holy tree's{03}rage caused this{03}horrible incident...{01}Do you believe that{03}was the only cause?{1E}{00}
#16B4 You may not have noticed,{03}but something changed{03}when those gems landed.{02}{00}
#16B5 I agree. Something did{03}change when the gems fell.{02}{00}
#16B6 If the holy tree alone{03}caused all this, then I've{03}failed in my duty.{01}I should have stopped{03}them from cutting down{03}the tree.{02}{00}
#16B7 They say that McCoy{03}halted construction of{03}the palace.{01}With no more work, all{03}the lumberjacks that came{03}to make money will leave.{02}{00}
#16B8 With no more work here,{03}Kolima can go back to{03}being a quiet little village.{02}{00}
#16B9 I've been a lumberjack{03}for years, but I've never{03}seen anything like this.{01}I think I'll go home{03}to my family in Imil.{02}{00}
#16BA I'm only a merchant, but{03}I got turned into a tree{03}just for staying here.{01}I think I'll head to Xian,{03}south of the river, now{03}that I'm a man again.{02}{00}
#16BB The village was really{03}booming with all that{03}work...{01}But what good is it if{03}you get turned into a{03}tree.{02}{00}
#16BC Remaining a quiet village{03}means remaining poor.{01}I was hoping Kolima{03}would flourish with all{03}the construction.{02}{00}
#16BD I'm a lumberjack,{03}and I'm okay{05} with that.{02}{00}
#16BE I wish I'd grabbed{03}some of those gems{03}that fell from the sky.{01}They must be{03}worth a fortune!{02}{00}
#16BF I was turned into{03}a tree for a while...{03}Can you believe it?{1E}{00}
#16C0 I think I now know what{03}it means to sink your{03}roots in one place.{01}But I wouldn't recommend{03}it to anyone else.{02}{00}
#16C1 Yeah, I can't even{03}believe it myself.{02}{00}
#16C2 Welcome to Bilibin.{05}{03}We'll forget that whole{03}curse business in no time!{02}{00}
#16C3 If you're talking about{03}the travelers from Imil,{03}they crossed the river.{02}{00}
#16C4 You're wondering about{03}the tree near the{03}village entrance?{01}It turned back{03}into a person. Thank{03}goodness!{02}{00}
#16C5 I saw Lord McCoy, the{03}chief of Bilibin,{03}walking through town{01}for the first time in{03}a long while...{01}He must be relieved{03}to see that the curse{03}has been broken.{02}{00}
#16C6 I hear the barricade gate{03}that blocked the road{03}to Kolima is open again.{02}{00}
#16C7 Those three kids vanished{03}during all that trouble{03}with the curse.{02}{00}
#16C8 The curse was broken{03}all thanks to the efforts{03}of three young warriors.{01}Say... You're not the{03}young warriors, are you?{1E}{00}
#16C9 That's amazing! You broke{03}the so-called curse!{02}{00}
#16CA I didn't think so. You{03}don't look very tough{03}at all.{02}{00}
#16CB Lord McCoy's men said{03}they saw the ones who{03}saved the village.{02}{00}
#16CC Have you ever been to{03}the village of Imil,{03}up north?{1E}{00}
#16CD Did you see the great{03}lighthouse over there?{03}I bet it was amazing!{02}{00}
#16CE If you ever go there,{03}be sure to visit their{03}famous lighthouse.{02}{00}
#16CF The eruption on the other{03}side of the mountains{03}seems to have stopped.{01}Things are finally{03}peaceful again.{02}{00}
#16D0 Now that the curse{03}is broken, why don't we{03}start construction again?{02}{00}
#16D1 It's over! Over! Milord{03}decided not to{03}build the palace.{02}{00}
#16D2 Hmph! My palace is not{03}finished!{01}McCoy loves that holy{03}tree more than he{03}loves me!{02}{00}
#16D3 I never want to be{03}turned into a tree again.{03}It was terrible.{02}{00}
#16D4 Not many lumberjacks are{03}willing to cut trees in{03}Kolima forest anymore.{02}{00}
#16D5 One of the two people{03}that came later was{03}apparently injured...{02}{00}
#16D6 That guy might turn{03}into a tree again if you{03}go near him...{02}{00}
#16D7 Lord McCoy seems to be{03}having a spat with his{03}wife. I wonder who'll win?{02}{00}
#16D8 Apparently, just about{03}anyone could just waltz{03}through that barricade.{02}{00}
#16D9 "The Gang of Three"{18}HA!{03}They're probably just{03}dozing somewhere.{02}{00}
#16DA I'm sure Lord McCoy will{03}give you a great reward!{03}I wonder what it will be!{02}{00}
#16DB They must be reporting{03}your deeds to Lord{03}McCoy right now!{02}{00}
#16DC I want to share with you{03}this sense of joy{03}that I feel!{02}{00}
#16DD As long as I'm okay, I{03}really don't care what{03}happens to anyone else.{02}{00}
#16DE We'd still be working{03}if we hadn't tried building{03}using the holy tree.{01}I told them{03}not to use it.{02}{00}
#16DF That was close!{01}Building a cursed{03}palace looks really{03}bad on your resume.{02}{00}
#16E0 He said he stopped{03}construction so that I{03}would not be cursed...{01}I think he's just{03}trying to weasel out{03}of his promise!{02}{00}
#16E1 Do you know if the{03}holy tree survived?{1E}{00}
#16E2 That makes sense. Those{03}who were turned into{03}trees are back to normal.{01}I am sure the holy tree{03}of Kolima Forest{03}survived, too!{02}{00}
#16E3 Then how did the people{03}who became trees get{03}returned to normal?{01}Did we just imagine{03}the whole thing?{02}{00}
#16E4 Thank goodness they{03}stopped construction{03}of the palace.{01}Lady McCoy seemed very{03}disappointed, though.{02}{00}
#16E5 It takes many years for a{03}tree to grow so old{03}that it becomes holy.{01}No human should{03}ever kill a tree as{03}precious as that.{02}{00}
#16E6 Sometimes, I wish I could{03}see what the palace{03}would have been like.{02}{00}
#16E7 I always miss Altin{03}in the winter.{01}I used to work there in{03}the mines, and the winters{03}were always so warm.{02}{00}
#16E8 My father says that it's{03}warm all year long on the{03}other side of the river.{02}{00}
#16E9 I wonder if there are{03}still beautiful gems in{03}Altin Mine...{02}{00}
#16EA My father has traveled{03}all over the world.{02}{00}
#16EB The road to Kolima is{03}open again. You can finally{03}continue on your journey.{02}{00}
#16EC Do you know what silk is?{1E}{00}
#16ED That's what they make in{03}Xian village on the other{03}side of the river.{01}The long road that runs{03}from there is called{03}Silk Road.{02}{00}
#16EE Caterpillars are raised{03}on mulberry leaves.{01}When the caterpillars'{03}cocoons are unwound,{03}they become silk thread.{01}The thread is then woven{03}into cloth used{03}to make clothing{01}for wealthy people like{03}Lady McCoy.{02}{00}
#16EF Traveling makes young{03}warriors stronger.{02}{00}
#16F0 Clothes made with silk{03}are so smooth and shiny.{02}{00}
#16F1 I thought I saw lights in{03}the sky over Imil last{03}night.{01}Could the legendary{03}lighthouse have been...?{02}{00}
#16F2 His eyes are red{03}because he stayed up{03}late last night.{02}{00}
#16F3 There's no doubt about it!{03}It's the light from the{03}lighthouse near Imil.{02}{00}
#16F4 What's the big deal? Why{03}are you making a fuss{03}about a lighthouse?{02}{00}
#16F5 Our weapons are the best{03}you can find...{01}But you should also try{03}the store in Altin, south{03}of the river.{02}{00}
#16F6 Altin's got good weapons,{03}but I still think my{03}selection is better.{02}{00}
#16F7 For some reason, the{03}ocean fills me with{03}hope and desire...{01}If you ever see the{03}ocean, remember men like{03}me, who dream about it.{02}{00}
#16F8 I wish I could go out{03}onto the ocean! Maybe I{03}should go on a journey...{01}But no, I don't have{03}that kind of courage.{02}{00}
#16F9 It turned out that all{03}the warriors hired by{03}Lord McCoy were useless!{01}Except for those cute{03}warriors who removed the{03}curse, that is.{02}{00}
#16FA They call themselves{03}warriors...{01}but you can't count on{03}any of them in real{03}emergencies.{02}{00}
#16FB Wasn't that curse in{03}Kolima horrifying?{1E}{00}
#16FC Even heroes like{03}you can feel fear.{01}Just imagine how{03}scary it was for us{03}poor townsfolk.{02}{00}
#16FD You can say that now,{03}because it's all over.{01}At the time, we{03}were all scared out{03}of our pants.{02}{00}
#16FE There will be fewer{03}guests now that the{03}fuss is over.{01}Whoever ended the{03}curse sure didn't do{03}us any favors.{02}{00}
#16FF Two specials! One dinner!{03}One sandwich! One{03}dessert! Hurry up!{02}{00}
#1700 Hey, you! Are you done{03}yet?{02}{00}
#1701 Almost...{02}{00}
#1702 If you want a meal,{03}speak to the waitress.{02}{00}
#1703 I really think the{03}head chef has changed.{03}It's too much!{02}{00}
#1704 I can't keep up{03}with his energy!{02}{00}
#1705 Let's see, serve them{03}water...then get the{03}silverware.{02}{00}
#1706 The head chef will yell{03}if you slow down...{02}{00}
#1707 I'm a little surprised{03}that the head chef{03}is working so hard.{02}{00}
#1708 There's no business{03}here, so I'm heading south{03}of the river to Xian.{01}Perhaps I'll take Silk{03}Road as far as Tolbi.{02}{00}
#1709 They served so much food{03}today!{01}If they do that{03}every day, they won't{03}make any money!{02}{00}
#170A That was some meal!{03}Don't you just love{03}the food here?{1E}{00}
#170B I know how you feel.{03}Go find a table{03}and pig out!{02}{00}
#170C What!? Why am I even{03}talking to you, when{03}I could be eating!?{02}{00}
#170D Ooooh...{05} That's it...{03}I tried my best, but I{03}couldn't eat another bite...{02}{00}
#170E The incident was resolved{03}before I knew it...{01}Maybe I'll head south of{03}the river to find{03}another job.{02}{00}
#170F I wonder what that eerie{03}howling coming from south{03}of the river was...{01}It really gave me{03}the heebie-jeebies.{02}{00}
#1710 Well, I was only acting{03}scared so that I'd fit in.{03}I wasn't really scared.{02}{00}
#1711 It'd be better for{03}business if the curse had{03}not been broken so fast.{02}{00}
#1712 I'll go to Kolima when{03}the customers are gone.{01}But in the meantime,{03}I'll cook like there's{03}no tomorrow!{02}{00}
#1713 Let's see... Soup...{03}salad...and...{03}I forgot the dressing.{02}{00}
#1714 The head chef was so{03}lazy until just the{03}other day, but all of{01}a sudden, I'm having{03}trouble keeping up with{03}how much he's changed.{02}{00}
#1715 It used to take them so{03}long to serve your order,{03}but not anymore!{02}{00}
#1716 When they stopped{03}building the palace, I{03}lost all my business.{01}Maybe I'll buy some silk in{03}Xian and sell it in Tolbi.{02}{00}
#1717 I wish I could eat like{03}this all the time!{02}{00}
#1718 I'd better eat a lot; that{03}chef's gonna burn out{03}in no time at this rate!{02}{00}
#1719 The food is such a good{03}value at this price!{02}{00}
#171A If a kid like this could{03}end the curse, maybe I{03}could have done the job.{02}{00}
#171B It looks like scary{03}things are happening all{03}over the world...{02}{00}
#171C The curse may be over,{03}but we can't drop our{03}guard yet.{01}It's still not entirely safe{03}wandering outside of{03}town.{02}{00}
#171D How about that? Our{03}wishes have come true.{02}{00}
#171E The signs of danger are{03}actually more numerous{03}than they were before.{02}{00}
#171F Peace will be kept{03}as long as we continue{03}our meditations.{02}{00}
#1720 Oh!{05} It's...{02}{00}
#1721 Oh! Sir!{02}{00}
#1722 We've been looking{03}everywhere for you!{02}{00}
#1723 The curse of the holy{03}tree... {05}You're the ones{03}who broke it, right?{1E}{00}
#1724 That's not true. We have{03}witnesses who say they{03}saw you in the forest!{02}{00}
#1725 It was you, wasn't it?{1E}{00}
#1726 You're under arrest!{02}{00}
#1727 Let's go.{03}Lord McCoy is waiting.{02}{00}
#1728 We've brought the{03}warriors, milord.{02}{00}
#1729 We brought the warriors,{03}as you ordered, milord.{02}{00}
#172A So{05}, yeh're the wee{05}{18}I{03}mean, brave{18}lads I{03}met before!{02}{00}
#172B So{05}, yeh're the wee{05}{18}I{03}mean, brave{18}lads who{03}saved Kolima?{02}{00}
#172C What were yer{03}names, again?{02}{00}
#172D What are yer{03}names, then?{02}{00}
#172E He's {11}{01}, sir,{03}and I'm {11}{02}...{02}{00}
#172F I am called {11}{03}.{02}{00}
#1730 And I am {11}{04}, from{03}the village of Imil.{02}{00}
#1731 {11}{01} and company...{02}{00}
#1732 And did I not decline{03}yer offer when we{03}first met?{1E}{00}
#1733 I did nae give it enough{03}consideration back then.{02}{00}
#1734 Are yeh no' just sayin'{03}that tae appease me?{02}{00}
#1735 And yet yeh went oan tae{03}break the curse despite{03}my words, did yeh not?{1E}{00}
#1736 Are yeh no' the ones{03}who ended the curse{03}of the holy tree?{1E}{00}
#1737 I humbly thank you.{02}{00}
#1738 Nae, yeh dinnae need tae{03}hide it.{05} My men told{03}me aught yeh did.{02}{00}
#1739 I was but worried yeh{03}might nae stop here{03}on yer way back.{02}{00}
#173A I want tae show my{03}appreciation for yer{03}help...{02}{00}
#173B I relied oan my money,{05}{03}but I forgot about{03}my people's needs.{02}{00}
#173C Yeh reminded me{03}of my duties.{02}{00}
#173D As lord of these lands, I{03}will do my best for{03}everyone's behalf.{02}{00}
#173E {11}{01}, it would honor me{03}greatly if yeh'd accept a wee{03}token of my gratitude.{02}{00}
#173F I could give it tae yeh{03}here, but would yeh no'{03}rather choose it yerself?{1E}{00}
#1740 Very well. Yeh can choose{03}somethin' that'll help{03}yeh along yer way.{02}{00}
#1741 Words are nae enough{03}tae express my regret{03}in doubting yeh.{01}Please, choose a token{03}in thanks for yer{03}service.{02}{00}
#1742 I will show {11}{01} and{03}his friends the way,{03}milord.{02}{00}
#1743 Many thanks tae yeh,{03}and tae yer companions,{03}as well!!{02}{00}
#1744 Visit me anytime!{05} Yeh'll{03}always find a warm{03}hearth here!{02}{00}
#1745 Follow me, and I'll{03}take you to the{03}treasure room.{02}{00}
#1746 Lord McCoy ordered that{03}{11}{01} and his companions{03}be brought here.{01}Please show them{03}their reward!{02}{00}
#1747 You may select a single{03}item from among these{03}four chests.{02}{00}
#1748 Please take your reward{03}before your depart!{02}{00}
#1749 You are always welcome in{03}the palace of Lord McCoy.{02}{00}
#174A These courageous{03}warriors deserve to{03}receive milord's treasure.{02}{00}
#174B You may choose only one{03}item, but I trust that all{03}of them will prove useful.{02}{00}
#174C Nonetheless...if your luck{03}is sour, you may end up{03}an item you do not need.{02}{00}
#174D {10} checked{03}the chest...{01}but it was empty.{02}{00}
#174E The treasure chest{03}is locked.{02}{00}
#174F Yeh've taught me that I{03}cannae judge a man by his{03}age or appearance.{02}{00}
#1750 You{05} are a fine warrior.{02}{00}
#1751 Do you think I can{03}become as fine a{03}warrior as you?{1E}{00}
#1752 Really?{05} Then I will try{03}my best!{02}{00}
#1753 Don't be so harsh...{05}{03}Just say yes, even if{03}you don't mean it.{02}{00}
#1754 I could never have gone{03}to the village of Kolima{03}knowing the danger.{01}You are truly courageous{03}warriors.{02}{00}
#1755 But I cannae figger out{03}how ye got past the{03}barricade...{01}when yeh did nae{03}e'en have the key...{02}{00}
#1756 Sometimes, we need{03}children to remind us of{03}our own responsibilities.{02}{00}
#1757 I will be a reliable{03}warrior, like {11}{01}{03}and his companions.{02}{00}
#1758 Don't leave, {11}{01}!{03}Be my mentor, and{03}teach me to be brave!{02}{00}
#1759 The people of Bilibin{03}will never forget{03}your bravery.{02}{00}
#175A I heard you received{03}a spectacular reward.{01}I hope that shows you{03}how nice Lord McCoy{03}really can be.{02}{00}
#175B Lady McCoy is quite{03}upset that the palace{03}construction was halted.{01}You probably won't want{03}to approach her for a{03}while.{02}{00}
#175C Things are looking grim{03}south of Goma Range...{03}Black clouds are looming.{01}If you're headed that{03}way, be prepared for{03}rain.{02}{00}
#175D Milady was very upset{03}when she left the room.{05}{03}Oh my...{02}{00}
#175E I feel sorry for the{03}warriors Lord{03}McCoy hired.{01}Milord will have strong{03}words for them if they{03}ever come back.{02}{00}
#175F I wonder what kind of{03}treasure Lord McCoy{03}gave them...{02}{00}
#1760 I wish she'd just{03}stop whining...{01}I don't have a palace{03}either, and you don't{03}see me crying about it.{02}{00}
#1761 They'd be guaranteed a{03}good life if they stayed in{03}Bilibin under the trust of{01}Lord McCoy. I wonder{03}why they travel on{03}as warriors.{02}{00}
#1762 I can tell when she's{03}upset{18}she always{03}slams the door.{02}{00}
#1763 For once, milord didn't{03}let Lady McCoy push{03}him around!{01}He seems much more{03}dashing now... Hee hee!{02}{00}
#1764 AAAAH!!!{02}{00}
#1765 Oh!{05} For a second, I{03}thought you were milady.{01}You really startled me!{02}{00}
#1766 Sometimes, a man's just{03}gotta put his foot down.{03}And oh! What a man!{02}{00}
#1767 The hole in this nightgown{03}is just getting bigger.{01}Has somebody else{03}been wearing it?{02}{00}
#1768 It's very reckless for{03}such young warriors to{03}face the holy tree...{02}{00}
#1769 I was watching from here.{03}After all that fuss,{03}you still went to Kolima?{1E}{00}
#176A I don't know how you{03}removed the curse,{03}but you're the best!{02}{00}
#176B You lie! I saw you{03}walking through the{03}barricade!{01}And then I saw you again,{03}coming back through after{03}the forest turned green!{02}{00}
#176C You looked very{03}courageous walking{03}toward Kolima.{02}{00}
#176D A courageous warrior{03}wouldn't think twice about{03}being turned into a tree.{02}{00}
#176E The reward you received{03}was indeed the greatest{03}of treasures.{01}Courageous people{03}have the best luck!{02}{00}
#176F You got a pretty nice{03}reward, but I think you{03}were just unlucky.{01}I don't want you to{03}feel bad, so I'll tell{03}you something good.{02}{00}
#1770 Oh, it looks like{03}she is okay.{02}{00}
#1771 They crossed the river{03}after pushing us down.{01}This is terrible!{03}How could anyone{03}do that?{02}{00}
#1772 She'll be swept{03}downstream if she isn't{03}pulled to shore!{02}{00}
#1773 AHHHH! Please! Anyone!{03}Please help!{02}{00}
#1774 Thank you! You saved{03}me from being washed{03}downstream!{02}{00}
#1775 Hey!{05} You're that guy!{02}{00}
#1776 Jill, are these the{03}people who saved you?{02}{00}
#1777 Remember me?{03}I was that tree!{02}{00}
#1778 I would have been swept{03}down the river if{03}it wasn't for you.{02}{00}
#1779 Please,{05} take this.{05}{03}It is a small token of{03}my appreciation.{02}{00}
#177A Jill gave {11}{01} a{03}special gift.{02}{00}
#177B I will never forget what{03}you've done for me.{03}Thank you so much!{02}{00}
#177C It was awful luck,{03}being turned into{03}trees just then.{01}We just wanted to pick{03}persimmons. Who knew{03}what would happen?{02}{00}
#177D I really like this spot{03}by the riverbank...{03}My heart feels at peace.{02}{00}
#177E I will think of you{03}whenever I eat{03}persimmons.{02}{00}
#177F I heard we were once{03}called the Gang of Three.{01}But now that she's gone,{05}{03}we're just the Gang of{03}Two...{01}The poor girl...{02}{00}
#1780 If only we hadn't tried{03}getting those persimmons,{03}she'd still be...{01}We'll never climb on each{03}other's shoulders again...{02}{00}
#1781 Whose idea was it to{03}pick persimmons,{03}anyway?{02}{00}
#1782 Well, it wasn't my{03}idea to go pick{03}persimmons.{02}{00}
#1783 These persimmons are{03}just like my memories...{03}So{05} bitter...{02}{00}
#1784 We worked so hard...{03}If only we had been{03}a little faster...{02}{00}
#1785 What a cruel world! We{03}just wanted to climb on{03}one another's shoulders!{02}{00}
#1786 Are you going to cross{03}the bridge?{02}{00}
#1787 Oh...{05}{05} Right!{03}Go right ahead!{02}{00}
#1788 For a while, I thought{03}no one would ever cross{03}this bridge again.{01}Enjoy every crossing,{03}for it could be your last!{02}{00}
#1789 You wouldn't understand,{03}but it's truly a joy{03}to cross this bridge.{02}{00}
#178A How did you get here?{03}Is the bridge open again?{1E}{00}
#178B Really?!{05} Then I can{03}go home to Kolima now?{01}I thought I'd never go{03}home, what with the{03}cursed forest and all!{02}{00}
#178C Oh... Then you came{03}through the forest?{03}That's too bad.{02}{00}
#178D I beginning to think{03}I'll be stuck in Fuchin{03}Temple until I die.{02}{00}
#178E Did you know that the{03}forest up ahead used to{03}be a vast prairie?{1E}{00}
#178F They say the prairie became{03}a vast forest overnight.{01}Nyunpa is the only person{03}who can pass through the{03}forest now...{01}Even Nyunpa doesn't{03}know why the prairie{03}turned into a forest.{02}{00}
#1790 You don't believe me, do{03}you? Well, it's the truth.{01}You see, these gems fell{03}from the sky, and{03}the next day,{01}there was a forest{03}where the prairie{03}used to be.{02}{00}
#1791 Om...{05} Om...{03}Blue lights in the north...{03}Terrifying!!!{01}A rain of broken stars...{03}A forest suddenly grows...{03}All omens...{02}{00}
#1792 Gems from the sky,{03}blue lights in the north...{03}All omens of disaster!{01}They match legends of{03}destruction described in{03}our oldest scrolls.{02}{00}
#1793 Nyunpa has not eaten in{03}days... He is going to{03}waste away to nothing.{02}{00}
#1794 Isn't it noble of him to{03}try to save the world by{03}becoming enlightened?{1E}{00}
#1795 However, I really do{03}not want to see{03}Nyunpa waste away.{02}{00}
#1796 Do you know what you{03}mean when you say that?{1E}{00}
#1797 Well,{05} one may have many{03}different opinions{03}in this world,{05} but...{01}I wish you could{03}understand our beliefs.{02}{00}
#1798 To achieve enlightenment,{03}one fasts to cleanse{03}body and mind...{01}Freed from worldly{03}concerns, one can focus{03}the mind's powers.{02}{00}
#1799 I don't feel safe going{03}home alone... I hope a{03}monk will escort me.{02}{00}
#179A Many stars fell from the{03}sky, just as it says{03}in the scrolls...{01}Is this truly a{03}portent of the world's{03}destruction?{02}{00}
#179B There is no point in{03}training if the world{03}is to be destroyed.{01}Maybe it is better{03}just to live happily.{02}{00}
#179C I can't imagine fasting...{03}It gets me depressed just{03}thinking about it.{02}{00}
#179D I will train to{03}become a good monk.{01}Then, I will save the{03}world, even if I must{03}sacrifice myself.{02}{00}
#179E .{05}.{05}.{05}.{05}.{05}.{05}{02}{00}
#179F Mmmm... Who is that?{03}Who speaks to my mind?{02}{00}
#17A0 Young master... Was that{05}{03}your voice I heard{03}in my mind just now?{1E}{00}
#17A1 Speak no lies to me!{02}{00}
#17A2 I knew it!{02}{00}
#17A3 I knew it!{02}{00}
#17A4 You follow{05} them,{05}{03}do you not?{1E}{00}
#17A5 You speak lies...{03}You are indeed{03}following them!{02}{00}
#17A6 I knew it!{02}{00}
#17A7 But you must go{03}through Mogall Forest,{03}the endless woods.{01}The forest itself is a{03}mystery, and its paths{03}even more so...{01}No ordinary man can{03}pass from one side to{03}the other.{02}{00}
#17A8 But perhaps I could,{03}young master.{02}{00}
#17A9 If you can endure the{03}trials in the waterfall{03}grotto, I will tell you.{02}{00}
#17AA Will you take the test?{1E}{00}
#17AB Then I cannot tell you.{03}Give up and go back{03}from whence you came.{02}{00}
#17AC You must survive the{03}test of the grotto{03}before you can pass{01}through Mogall Forest.{03}Will you take the test?{1E}{00}
#17AD Do not worry. You will{03}be permitted to enter{03}the grotto.{02}{00}
#17AE Go now,{05} {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#17AF Just remember, you are{03}not the only ones{03}who can read minds.{02}{00}
#17B0 Speak to the monk{03}standing beneath the{03}falls.{02}{00}
#17B1 You enjoy reading the{03}minds of others, do{03}you not?{1E}{00}
#17B2 If you overdo it, you{03}will soon learn to despise{03}the ability.{02}{00}
#17B3 That is good. Enjoy{03}reading the minds of{03}others while you still can.{02}{00}
#17B4 I have already heard of{03}your test from Master{03}Nyunpa. You may enter.{02}{00}
#17B5 The test of Fuchin Falls{03}is a difficult one. Do not{03}enter until you are ready.{02}{00}
#17B6 Can such young warriors{03}endure the trial of{03}the grotto?{02}{00}
#17B7 Young master, did you{03}complete the test?{1E}{00}
#17B8 Why, you have mastered{03}the secrets of Fuchin{03}Temple!?{02}{00}
#17B9 But you must have...{02}{00}
#17BA Master Nyunpa is waiting{03}for you...{02}{00}
#17BB Proceed to the temple.{02}{00}
#17BC Master Nyunpa is waiting{03}for you...{03}Proceed to the temple.{02}{00}
#17BD The warriors have{03}mastered the secrets{03}of Fuchin Temple.{02}{00}
#17BE Excellent, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#17BF I am glad to see you{03}master the secrets of{03}Fuchin Temple!{02}{00}
#17C0 We monks call the{03}power you have{03}obtained Ki.{02}{00}
#17C1 You seem{05} confused,{03}{11}{01}.{1E}{00}
#17C2 This is called "force" by{03}the western world, but it{03}is really spiritual power.{02}{00}
#17C3 You possess great wisdom{03}for one so young, but I{03}feel I must explain this.{02}{00}
#17C4 It is called "force" by{03}the western world, but it{03}is really spiritual power.{02}{00}
#17C5 I will teach you, as I{03}promised. Use this power{03}to go through the forest.{02}{00}
#17C6 What would happen if you{03}let loose this energy{03}in the forest?{02}{00}
#17C7 Ha ha! You are{03}curious, no?{1E}{00}
#17C8 I can read minds, you{03}know.{05} You are curious,{03}aren't you?{1E}{00}
#17C9 Monsters that wait in{03}hiding would show{03}themselves.{01}You would then try to{03}defeat them, would you{03}not?{1E}{00}
#17CA Sometimes, you must let{03}go of your belief that{03}fighting solves problems...{02}{00}
#17CB Ha ha... That is right.{03}There is no good in{03}wanton destruction.{02}{00}
#17CC Monsters are cowardly.{03}They will run once they{03}know you can see them.{02}{00}
#17CD They are creatures of the{03}woods... So they do not{03}get lost there.{02}{00}
#17CE Use this energy to find{03}the monsters,{05} then follow{03}them. It is that simple.{02}{00}
#17CF Now that I have passed{03}my knowledge of Ki{03}along...{01}I am without worries.{03}Farewell, {11}{01}.{03}Take care of yourself...{02}{00}
#17D0 Master Nyunpa seems{03}quite relieved.{01}Do not fail,{03}young warriors.{02}{00}
#17D1 We cannot sit idly by.{03}We too must learn the{03}secrets of Fuchin Temple.{02}{00}
#17D2 The Fuchin Temple{03}is a pleasant place.{03}I feel at peace here.{02}{00}
#17D3 Oh, {11}{01}! What took you so{03}long? Master Nyunpa has{03}become enlightened!{01}He no longer{03}responds to our words...{02}{00}
#17D4 Ahhh. Master Nyunpa...{03}He has passed away...{02}{00}
#17D5 Master Nyunpa has wasted{03}away at last.{02}{00}
#17D6 Now, he truly is beyond{03}the world's concerns.{03}Is he watching over us?{1E}{00}
#17D7 I believed that once.{03}But now, I am no{03}longer so sure.{02}{00}
#17D8 Yes...{05} This seems{03}very wrong.{01}The world has lost{03}something great,{03}now that Nyunpa is gone...{02}{00}
#17D9 Gems falling from the sky,{03}mountains erupting,{03}oceans raging...{01}Fuchin Temple is the only{03}haven left for me in{03}such a frightful world.{02}{00}
#17DA I knew Master Nyunpa{03}was fasting to save{03}the world...{01}even if it meant his own{03}death... But I am saddened{03}that he is gone...{02}{00}
#17DB Master Nyunpa reached{03}enlightenment during his{03}lifetime. Amazing...{02}{00}
#17DC Master Nyunpa is nothing{03}but skin and bones...{03}like a dried fish!{02}{00}
#17DD He can't leave us yet...{03}He still has so much{03}to teach us!{02}{00}
#17DE ...............{02}{00}
#17DF {11}{01}...{05} Is that you...?{05}{03}I am...{05}counting on you...{01}to bring peace...{05}{03}to the world...{02}{00}
#17E0 You don't have to try{03}so hard.{05} You are curious,{03}are you not?{1E}{00}
#17E1 The dragon's flame{03}illuminates the path of{03}truth in darkness.{02}{00}
#17E2 The secret of Ki shall{03}be revealed to the{03}disciples of truth.{02}{00}
#17E3 Rays of light give{03}birth to shadows,{03}revealing the way.{02}{00}
#17E4 It's a statue of an{03}eyeless dragon.{01}What went in{03}the sockets?{02}{00}
#17E5 It's a statue of a dragon{03}with burning red eyes.{02}{00}
#17E6 The broken sign reads:{01}North: Fuchin Temple{03}South: Mogall Prairie...{02}{00}
#17E7 This is Xian. Travelers{03}are welcome here!{03}Relax. Stay long.{02}{00}
#17E8 Young warriors,{03}very gallant!{01}You came through{03}Mogall Forest?{1E}{00}
#17E9 Incredible.{03}I respect your deeds.{02}{00}
#17EA Came from Altin?{03}No. That is a lie.{01}Silk Road is blocked.{03}No one can come{03}that way.{02}{00}
#17EB Xian is the village of{03}kinu. Kinu means silk.{03}Silk makes the best cloth.{02}{00}
#17EC Do you know Master Feh?{1E}{00}
#17ED There are many scary{03}thieves now, but Master{03}Feh is scarier.{01}Xian is safe, because{03}thieves are afraid to go{03}near Master Feh.{02}{00}
#17EE Master Feh is a martial{03}artist. He is very strong.{01}Master Feh teaches{03}martial arts at the Xian{03}school.{02}{00}
#17EF Martial arts are very{03}popular in Xian.{01}All warriors should{03}learn martial arts.{02}{00}
#17F0 You warriors should visit{03}Master Feh's school.{03}You will be surprised!{02}{00}
#17F1 My clothes are not silk.{03}Silk is very expensive.{03}Only the wealthy wear it.{02}{00}
#17F2 Hoo-whaaa...{03}Hachaaa!{02}{00}
#17F3 Heh heh heh...{02}{00}
#17F4 My kung fu is strong.{01}If you go to Master Feh's{03}school every day, someday{03}you will be strong too.{02}{00}
#17F5 Disasters from the sky...{03}Many, many thieves...{01}But I do not worry. Xian{03}has many kung fu masters.{03}Master Feh is strong.{02}{00}
#17F6 This is the mulberry{03}orchard.{01}When the season comes,{03}all Xian comes to{03}harvest.{02}{00}
#17F7 You are the warriors{03}from the school... Are you{03}strong warriors?{1E}{00}
#17F8 I am happy to see strong{03}warriors. I hope you will{03}go west.{02}{00}
#17F9 You are weak warriors?{03}Very few warriors would{03}call themselves weak.{02}{00}
#17FA What are you doing! You{03}made me spill my water!{02}{00}
#17FB Now I must get water{03}again. This work is{03}hard on my back.{02}{00}
#17FC Do not speak to me.{03}I might spill my water.{02}{00}
#17FD Wha{05}-Wha{05}-What happened?{03}The tree jumped on{03}its own!{02}{00}
#17FE ...It jumped again...{05}{03}I am too tired...{02}{00}
#17FF These children must have{03}come to study kung fu{03}at Master Feh's School.{02}{00}
#1800 You young warriors look{03}strong. But which is{03}stronger...{01}You, or the kung fu{03}taught at Master{03}Feh's school?{02}{00}
#1801 I hope many people come{03}to know the silk of{03}Xian.{02}{00}
#1802 Those who need no{03}weapons have true{03}strength.{01}Master Feh is number{03}one.{02}{00}
#1803 Fighting with kicks and{03}punches is effective.{01}Everyone should{03}remember this.{02}{00}
#1804 Master Feh's school is{03}training. It makes us{03}very strong.{02}{00}
#1805 Silk is shiny and smooth.{03}It feels good on my skin.{03}I'm obsessed with it.{02}{00}
#1806 Breaking trees with my{03}hand{05} hurts me very much.{01}But it does not hurt{03}Master Feh. He is a{03}great master.{02}{00}
#1807 Master Feh said "YAH!"{03}and then the thieves fell.{02}{00}
#1808 The orchard gives the{03}village life. It is very{03}precious to us.{02}{00}
#1809 Going west alone is very{03}dangerous.{01}I must find someone to{03}take me west.{02}{00}
#180A I must carry water{03}every day. I can't{03}stand it!{02}{00}
#180B The mulberry harvest is{03}over. Now there is much{03}food for the caterpillars!{01}The cocoon threads will{03}become silk.{01}Merchants will buy a lot{03}when they come.{02}{00}
#180C Farm work is very hard.{03}Warriors have no idea{03}how hard it is.{02}{00}
#180D Soon, Master Hammet will{03}come. He will buy {03}much silk.{02}{00}
#180E Farm work is hard on the{03}shoulders. It is hard on{03}the back, too.{02}{00}
#180F Xian silk is sent on{03}Silk Road to Tolbi.{01}Tolbi is a big town{03}in the southwest.{02}{00}
#1810 Silk Road ends in{03}Tolbi. It is a big,{03}big town.{02}{00}
#1811 Silk Road is full{03}of silk merchants.{02}{00}
#1812 Merchants say Tolbi is{03}very beautiful,{03}very wonderful...{02}{00}
#1813 Follow Silk Road.{03}When you see the mountain{03}fork, go north.{01}Then you will see{03}Altin.{02}{00}
#1814 There is a mine in Altin.{03}There is lots of steel{03}and lots of gems.{02}{00}
#1815 Altin has many men.{03}All scary men, too.{02}{00}
#1816 Mining is very hard work.{03}It takes great strength.{03}It is difficult for women.{02}{00}
#1817 Xian has martial arts,{03}but kung fu alone is{03}not enough. People worry.{01}For that reason, it is{03}not strange to sell{03}weapons in Xian.{02}{00}
#1818 Some say fighting with{03}weapons is cowardly.{03}I say not true.{01}There are many{03}fighters, and many ways{03}of fighting.{02}{00}
#1819 Martial artists can't use{03}heavy armor. If they do,{03}they can't move quickly.{01}...But not warriors.{03}Using much armor is good{03}for them.{02}{00}
#181A In warrior battles, you{03}fight with weapons.{01}In kung fu, you fight{03}by dodging.{02}{00}
#181B Xian's special armor is{03}not suited to warriors...{01}It is better to buy{03}normal armor.{02}{00}
#181C Xian is a village of{03}craftsmen. They never buy{03}items. They make them.{02}{00}
#181D Warriors should learn{03}about the towns they{03}visit.{01}Just traveling and{03}fighting is a sad{03}life.{02}{00}
#181E Normally, many merchants{03}come to the village, but{03}they have not come yet.{01}I think{03}that is strange.{02}{00}
#181F All the people who came{03}to eat are from Xian.{03}What happened there?{02}{00}
#1820 When you go to a new{03}place, follow the rules{03}in the new place.{01}This is an old{03}saying in Xian.{02}{00}
#1821 When many merchants{03}come, my business{03}is good.{01}But if no merchants{03}come, my business is{03}very bad.{02}{00}
#1822 There are fewer{03}travelers, so fewer{03}people eat here.{01}Where are all the{03}travelers?{02}{00}
#1823 I came to Xian from very{03}distant lands to spread{03}good will.{02}{00}
#1824 When you stay in Xian{03}for a long time, you{03}start to speak strangely.{01}My head gets very{03}confused...{02}{00}
#1825 This is Master Feh's{03}school...{03}You came to watch?{1E}{00}
#1826 Promise me you will{03}be quiet.{02}{00}
#1827 Warriors should learn{03}martial arts. They will{03}help in battles.{02}{00}
#1828 Strong kicks are very{03}important.{03}Kick, kick, kick!{01}That is how you do it.{02}{00}
#1829 I want to learn, so{03}I train. Quick punches{03}are very good.{01}Master Feh is very{03}good.{02}{00}
#182A Flexibility and jumping{03}are very important in{03}kung fu.{02}{00}
#182B Everyone in Xian can{03}do martial arts.{01}But the Feh School{03}of martial arts is{03}the most elite.{02}{00}
#182C Just listening does not{03}make one strong.{03}I learn by watching.{02}{00}
#182D Master Feh is very busy.{03}Do you still wish to{03}see him?{1E}{00}
#182E Look there. You see that{03}line? Stand there and{03}use Chi.{01}If that tree falls, I will{03}take you to see{03}Master Feh.{02}{00}
#182F You will not see Master{03}Feh? That is{03}too bad.{02}{00}
#1830 Master Feh is very busy.{03}He is speaking with his{03}daughter, Feizhi.{01}You cannot enter now.{02}{00}
#1831 Warriors fight with{03}weapons. Kung fu means{03}little to you.{02}{00}
#1832 Practicing kicks hurts{03}my feet very much.{03}But I still try hard.{02}{00}
#1833 That punch was good!{03}You surprise me, warrior.{02}{00}
#1834 I move too quickly.{03}You can't hit me with{03}your weapon. Try it.{02}{00}
#1835 Warriors came to learn{03}the Feh School's kung fu.{03}That is how famous it is.{02}{00}
#1836 Great kick. Kick from the{03}hip. That causes much pain{03}when it hits.{02}{00}
#1837 You are the warriors who{03}came to study, yes?{01}It is too much to ask{03}to see Master Feh.{02}{00}
#1838 Master Feh is talking{03}with Feizhi about{03}something very important.{01}You cannot disturb them.{02}{00}
#1839 Ya! What happened!?{03}The tree fell on its own!{02}{00}
#183A You cannot push it with{03}your hands. Attack it{03}with Chi.{02}{00}
#183B What did you do,{03}warrior?{02}{00}
#183C The warrior used Chi!{03}He did it from the line...{03}and the tree fell!{02}{00}
#183D He knows kung fu!{03}Do you know kung fu?{1E}{00}
#183E Your Chi must be{03}strong if you can{03}use it from afar.{01}I must tell Master Feh!{02}{00}
#183F It is unbelievable that{03}someone who does not{03}know kung fu can use Chi.{02}{00}
#1840 Ya! What happened!?{03}The door opened on{03}its own!{02}{00}
#1841 Feizhi! Wait!{02}{00}
#1842 Are you worried{03}that Hsu is late?{02}{00}
#1843 He is only a little late{03}in returning from Lama{03}Temple. Do not worry!{02}{00}
#1844 Something is wrong with{03}Hsu... I sense it.{02}{00}
#1845 Ahhh, Feizhi...{03}Is it your power again?{02}{00}
#1846 Ever since gems fell from{03}the sky and hit me, I{03}have sensed bad things.{02}{00}
#1847 You say you sense evil{03}ever since you received{03}the power of prophecy.{01}You have told{03}me already.{02}{00}
#1848 I do not believe it, Feizhi.{03}Your visions are just{03}coincidences.{02}{00}
#1849 My visions came true{03}many times, no?{02}{00}
#184A I had a vision about{03}Mogall Forest, and that{03}came true...{02}{00}
#184B Yes, your predictions{03}came true, Feizhi. It was{03}very surprising!{02}{00}
#184C The flood in Altin...{03}Did I not predict{03}that, too?{02}{00}
#184D All Feizhi's predictions{03}come true.{02}{00}
#184E See, Father?{02}{00}
#184F I have heard this all.{03}I was surprised, too, but{03}it is still coincidence.{02}{00}
#1850 You still don't{03}believe it?{02}{00}
#1851 Hsu is late, so you{03}worry too much. But do{03}not think bad thoughts.{02}{00}
#1852 You sent people to{03}find Hsu, correct?{02}{00}
#1853 Stubborn old man.{02}{00}
#1854 What did you say, Feizhi?{03}You should not speak{03}so to your elders.{02}{00}
#1855 I will not ask anyone.{03}I will go alone, then!{02}{00}
#1856 It is too dangerous.{02}{00}
#1857 Ya! Master Feh!{03}Feizhi has gone!{02}{00}
#1858 Feizhi was very angry.{03}She was frightening!{02}{00}
#1859 Hsu is in danger.{03}Feizhi is going to help.{02}{00}
#185A Feizhi knows kung fu.{03}She will be all right.{02}{00}
#185B Feizhi is alone. She{03}cannot go too far.{02}{00}
#185C She will give up soon{03}enough. Until then,{03}let her be.{02}{00}
#185D The tree... It fell.{03}What happened?{02}{00}
#185E The warrior did it.{03}He used Chi.{02}{00}
#185F Warrior, you...{03}Can you use Chi?{1E}{00}
#1860 Do it again, warrior.{03}Show me your Chi.{02}{00}
#1861 Warrior, you speak{03}nonsense. You used Chi.{03}Do it again!{1E}{00}
#1862 Show me your Chi,{03}warrior.{02}{00}
#1863 I want to see your{03}Chi, warrior.{02}{00}
#1864 Warrior, let me see your{03}Chi now.{02}{00}
#1865 Feizhi is gone! It is{03}dangerous outside the{03}village. I am worried.{02}{00}
#1866 Feizhi is stronger than{03}she looks. She will{03}be okay.{02}{00}
#1867 Warrior, show us your{03}Chi, like before.{02}{00}
#1868 Warrior, that was great,{03}but Master Feh's Chi{03}is much stronger.{02}{00}
#1869 Warrior, show me your{03}Chi. I want to see it{03}very badly.{02}{00}
#186A Feizhi, I know. I know{03}how you feel...{01}But it is not good{03}to ignore Master Feh.{02}{00}
#186B My kick and punch are{03}very loud! They cause{03}much pain when they hit.{02}{00}
#186C Show us your{03}Chi. Now. Do it now.{03}I want to see it.{02}{00}
#186D I am shocked that this{03}warrior can use Chi.{01}What will Master Feh say{03}when he sees it?{02}{00}
#186E Warrior, will you{03}show me your Chi?{1E}{00}
#186F Very good. Now show me.{02}{00}
#1870 What you can do{03}is an incredible thing.{03}Hiding it is not good.{02}{00}
#1871 Feizhi is gone! It is{03}dangerous outside of{03}the village. I am worried.{02}{00}
#1872 Feizhi is stronger than{03}she looks. She will be{03}all right.{02}{00}
#1873 I know why you can{03}use Chi, warrior.{03}I know.{02}{00}
#1874 Warrior, Chi is a great{03}power. Why hide it?{01}The master wants to see{03}your Chi very much.{02}{00}
#1875 I want to see the Chi of{03}a warrior who knows{03}martial arts.{01}Why won't you show me,{03}warrior?{02}{00}
#1876 Feizhi, I know how you{03}feel. But, it is not wise{03}to ignore Master Feh.{02}{00}
#1877 My kick and punch are{03}very loud! They cause{03}much pain when they hit.{02}{00}
#1878 Warrior, show me your{03}Chi. Now. Do it now.{03}I want to see it.{02}{00}
#1879 Warrior, do not hide your{03}Chi from Master Feh.{03}It will make me a liar!{02}{00}
#187A Look! The tree fell.{02}{00}
#187B Master, did you see?{03}The warrior used Chi!{02}{00}
#187C Master, what is the{03}matter?{02}{00}
#187D He did not do it from{03}the line, so I{03}cannot be sure.{02}{00}
#187E That is not good.{03}Warrior, do it right!{03}Do it from the line.{02}{00}
#187F Warrior, use your Chi{03}from the line.{02}{00}
#1880 Warrior, please!{03}Use your Chi from the{03}line.{02}{00}
#1881 Warrior, the rules{03}require you to use{03}Chi from the line!{01}You cannot back down{03}now.{02}{00}
#1882 So close! Warrior, use{03}Chi from the line.{03}Do it again.{02}{00}
#1883 Ya! The tree fell!{02}{00}
#1884 Master, did you see?{03}The warrior used Chi.{02}{00}
#1885 The warrior's Chi is{03}excellent! Are you{03}surprised, Master?{02}{00}
#1886 What is wrong, Master?{02}{00}
#1887 Hmmmm... The warrior{03}did make the tree fall.{03}I grant you that...{02}{00}
#1888 Is something wrong with{03}the warrior's Chi?{02}{00}
#1889 What the warrior did...{03}It is not Chi.{02}{00}
#188A What? It is not Chi?{02}{00}
#188B Hmmm... It looks very{03}similar...but it is not{03}Chi.{02}{00}
#188C Warrior... Have you{05}{03}been to Fuchin Temple?{1E}{00}
#188D Ah... I knew it.{02}{00}
#188E Hmmm... That is strange.{02}{00}
#188F How are Chi and{03}Fuchin Temple related?{02}{00}
#1890 I learned my Chi{05}{03}from Master Hama{03}of Lama Temple.{02}{00}
#1891 Then{05} it is the same{03}as Chi,{05} is it not?{02}{00}
#1892 Very similar...{03}But still different...{02}{00}
#1893 Chi concentrates the{03}energy of the body into{03}the hand...{01}then releases it onto{03}a distant object.{02}{00}
#1894 You, warrior, used energy{03}focused from the mind.{03}Understand?{1E}{00}
#1895 This warrior is wise.{01}The power to will{03}something to move{03}requires much wisdom.{02}{00}
#1896 Remember this...{01}Wishing for something{03}is the same as thinking{03}very hard.{02}{00}
#1897 Fuchin's Ki releases the{03}mind's energy like Chi{03}releases the body's.{02}{00}
#1898 The body's energy has{03}limits, but mental energy{05}{03}has few limits.{02}{00}
#1899 Train your Ki. It{03}will grow very strong.{03}Do your best, warrior.{02}{00}
#189A Practice, everyone!{03}Chi has its limits,{03}but anyone can use it.{01}Practice, practice!{03}Until you learn the power{03}of Chi.{02}{00}
#189B Warrior, you are great.{03}You have earned{03}my respect.{02}{00}
#189C Everyone wants to learn{03}the Chi of Master Feh.{01}I will study kung fu{03}to learn Chi.{02}{00}
#189D Concentrate energy into{03}the hands{05} and release{03}it as Chi.{01}This is what Master Feh{03}teaches. But it is hard.{01}Master Hsu went to{03}Lama Temple. There, he{03}learns from Master Hama.{02}{00}
#189E Lama Temple is far west.{03}It is in Lamakan Desert.{01}Master Hsu went there{03}to train. He will come{03}back strong.{02}{00}
#189F I did not think much of{03}you, warrior. I apologize.{02}{00}
#18A0 Where did Feizhi go?{03}I am very worried.{02}{00}
#18A1 Master Hsu is late.{03}I can understand why{03}Feizhi worries.{02}{00}
#18A2 I will learn Chi. I will{03}become strong. Stronger{03}than Master Feh...{02}{00}
#18A3 Your Chi is Fuchin{03}Temple's. How is it{03}different from our Chi?{02}{00}
#18A4 I don't care which Chi{03}it is. Kung fu's{03}or Fuchin's...{01}I must learn it.{02}{00}
#18A5 Master Hama's Chi can{03}shatter boulders.{01}Can Master Hsu{03}shatter boulders with{03}his Chi?{02}{00}
#18A6 Follow Silk Road straight.{03}Pass through the canyon.{03}You will see Lama Temple.{02}{00}
#18A7 Warrior, you use weapons{03}and Chi. You are very{03}dangerous.{02}{00}
#18A8 Feizhi is not in the Feh{03}School anymore...{03}It is sad. Very lonely.{02}{00}
#18A9 Feizhi worries only about{03}Master Hsu. It makes{03}me a little jealous.{02}{00}
#18AA Learning Chi...{03}is very hard.{03}Master Feh is amazing.{02}{00}
#18AB Can such a young warrior{03}really do it? It is{03}hard to believe...{02}{00}
#18AC You are a great warrior.{03}I must train, like you{03}must have trained.{02}{00}
#18AD It is locked.{02}{00}
#18AE Warriors cannot use...{03}Wait.{05} This is different{03}from Chi.{02}{00}
#18AF Do not step over{03}the line, warrior.{02}{00}
#18B0 Stand beyond the line.{03}Then try your Chi.{02}{00}
#18B1 Do you think I am{03}following you, warrior?{1E}{00}
#18B2 You are mistaken,{03}warrior. I just want{03}to go west.{01}You want to go west, too.{03}So, we end up going west{05}{03}together.{02}{00}
#18B3 You are right, warrior.{03}I am just going west,{05}{03}like you are going west.{02}{00}
#18B4 You're very persistent,{03}warrior. I just want to{03}go west.{01}So, we end up going west{05}{03}together.{02}{00}
#18B5 Yahh! Silk Road!{03}Boulders block the road!{02}{00}
#18B6 My vision...{03}It came true.{02}{00}
#18B7 Hsu, Hsu!{02}{00}
#18B8 It is no good. I{03}cannot hear{03}Hsu's voice!{02}{00}
#18B9 What do I do?{03}Warrior, should I return{03}to Xian?{1E}{00}
#18BA Going back is no option.{03}I must find Hsu.{02}{00}
#18BB You are right, warrior.{03}Of course not.{03}I must find Hsu.{02}{00}
#18BC Hsu is in danger.{03}I can sense it. I must{03}find him soon.{02}{00}
#18BD Is this your first time{03}to visit Altin?{1E}{00}
#18BE Look at how much Altin{03}has changed!{01}You can't do much{03}here until the{03}waters subside.{02}{00}
#18BF We must look a{03}lot like a coastal{03}town, huh?{1E}{00}
#18C0 Nothing gets by you...{03}Altin never even had a{03}well in the old days.{01}Water-spewing{03}monsters are what{03}waterlogged the village.{02}{00}
#18C1 The day the gems fell{03}from the sky{05}, these{03}water-spewing monsters{01}appeared out of nowhere.{03}Now the village is ruined{03}because of them!{02}{00}
#18C2 How can those creatures{03}spit up so much water?{02}{00}
#18C3 How horrible! My house{03}is totally coated{03}in monster spit.{02}{00}
#18C4 Even the mine is{03}submerged. No one{03}can enter it.{02}{00}
#18C5 If we could just destroy{03}the monsters, all the{03}water should drain away.{02}{00}
#18C6 Altin always used to run{03}short on water. Now{03}we're all flooded in.{01}Either way, we just{03}have bad luck when{03}it comes to water.{02}{00}
#18C7 We can't drink the water{03}the monsters spew!{03}It's disgusting.{01}Won't anyone ever slay{03}those beasts?{02}{00}
#18C8 The waters around here{03}have subsided...{01}I wonder if the holes in{03}the mine allowed the{03}water to drain.{02}{00}
#18C9 The water beasts looked{03}exactly like Altin's{03}guardian statues...{01}Could the guardian{03}statues have turned{03}into the monsters?{02}{00}
#18CA The waters have flushed{03}out tons of rock{03}from the mine.{01}Maybe now we'll find{03}gems and ore we've{03}never even seen before.{02}{00}
#18CB You came to Altin at a{03}bad time. You're terribly{03}unlucky, huh?{02}{00}
#18CC It's almost like they're{03}turning the air itself{03}into water!{02}{00}
#18CD I'm glad I saved my very{03}first love letter, but what{03}about everything else?{02}{00}
#18CE Even the toughest of{03}miners can't do much{03}in this water.{02}{00}
#18CF If the water beasts{03}continue to flood us...{01}our entire village will{03}be submerged.{02}{00}
#18D0 Water is nice, but not{03}when it's flooding{03}your home.{02}{00}
#18D1 Ugh. The monsters spewed{03}out all of this water.{03}It smells foul...{02}{00}
#18D2 As the monsters go away,{03}the waters recede.{01}Maybe all of the{03}monsters will disappear{03}pretty soon...{02}{00}
#18D3 Come to think of it, it{03}looked like our guardian{03}statue was spewing water.{02}{00}
#18D4 It'll be better than{03}digging up more of those{03}durned ancient relics.{02}{00}
#18D5 Oh no... The whole{03}house is soaked...{02}{00}
#18D6 If the monster that did{03}this were here right now,{03}I'd give him such a smack!{01}I'm just{03}kidding... I'm opposed{03}to all this violence.{02}{00}
#18D7 It's going to take{03}a lot of work to get{03}this house back in shape.{02}{00}
#18D8 One blow's not enough.{03}Jab! Jab! Hook! Then{03}comes the uppercut!{02}{00}
#18D9 Are you trying to{03}find your way west{03}through the mountains?{1E}{00}
#18DA There should be a passage{03}that leads west at the{03}bottom of the mine.{02}{00}
#18DB I don't know what you{03}did, but we are grateful{03}you defeated the beasts.{02}{00}
#18DC Don't be too harsh{03}on those beasts.{02}{00}
#18DD I thought the village was{03}done for. I'm glad we{03}didn't give up hope.{02}{00}
#18DE I'm just glad to get{03}my house back.{02}{00}
#18DF I didn't want to leave{03}my hometown...{03}That's why I came back.{02}{00}
#18E0 I heard someone killed{03}the water beasts.{03}That's why I came back.{01}There's no place{03}like home.{02}{00}
#18E1 You defeated those{03}monsters, didn't you?{1E}{00}
#18E2 Here, let me thank{03}you with...a kiss!{01}Hey, you're turning{03}beet-red!{02}{00}
#18E3 Oh, you didn't? Still, I'm{03}happy to be back home,{03}so here's a kiss!{01}Hey, you're turning{03}beet-red!{02}{00}
#18E4 The bottom of the mine...{03}The end of the{03}easternmost passage...{01}I won't give that up.{02}{00}
#18E5 My husband's sense for{03}finding treasure has{03}never failed.{01}Once the water recedes,{03}we'll dig up that spot{03}he found.{02}{00}
#18E6 Mom and Pop know{03}something about the{03}bottom of the mine.{01}I wish they'd tell{03}me what it was.{02}{00}
#18E7 Do you want weapons?{1E}{00}
#18E8 I'll sell you anything{03}you want once the waters{03}have receded.{01}What in the world{03}did we do to deserve{03}this fate?{02}{00}
#18E9 You wouldn't say that if{03}you saw my weapons. I{03}wish I could show you.{02}{00}
#18EA Thank goodness the water{03}has receded. I can open{03}up shop again!{02}{00}
#18EB Cripes... Is this how{03}my weapon shop ends?{03}As a sunken disaster?{02}{00}
#18EC Only a merchant knows{03}the joy of being open to{03}do business again.{02}{00}
#18ED My store is submerged...{03}I want to sell armor,{03}but there's no way.{02}{00}
#18EE It's great that I can{03}sell armor out of my{03}shop again.{02}{00}
#18EF All my armor inventory is{03}rusting even as we speak.{02}{00}
#18F0 We dried off all{03}that armor and{03}polished it up!{01}There should be no trace{03}of rust now.{02}{00}
#18F1 Oh, no! What will I do{03}if all my merchandise{03}is soaked?{02}{00}
#18F2 None of my goods were{03}damaged. I'm going to sell{03}like there's no tomorrow!{02}{00}
#18F3 If my goods are wet, I'll{03}have to dry them out{03}before I can sell them.{02}{00}
#18F4 A few things got damp...{01}But it shouldn't affect the{03}quality, so you can use{03}them without any worries.{01}...Maybe I'll put up a{03}sign to explain it all.{02}{00}
#18F5 We got a little damp, but{03}we're doing okay. We {03}must count our blessings.{1E}{00}
#18F6 After all, a lot of{03}good people have been{03}hurt in this flooding.{02}{00}
#18F7 You have to remember,{03}lots of people lost{03}everything they own.{01}It's just sad, when{03}you think about it.{02}{00}
#18F8 I'd give anything for{03}someone to return{03}Altin to its former glory.{01}You look pretty young,{03}but if you are a true{03}warrior, please help us.{02}{00}
#18F9 I came from Xian.{03}I cook good food.{03}Eat up!{02}{00}
#18FA None of us can go{03}home until the{03}water subsides.{02}{00}
#18FB The guests in Room One{03}moved back home when{03}the waters receded.{02}{00}
#18FC The guests in Room Two{03}also went home after the{03}waters receded.{02}{00}
#18FD We'll come through this{03}all right, but I'm afraid{03}the village is done for.{02}{00}
#18FE I know they don't look{03}so tough, but being{03}warriors and all,{01}maybe they can help us.{02}{00}
#18FF I became a cook after{03}I came to Altin, but I still{03}cook well.{02}{00}
#1900 Most of the village is{03}still submerged...{01}It will be a long time{03}before Altin returns{03}to its former glory.{02}{00}
#1901 It looks like the water{03}has receded a bit,{01}but it will be a long{03}time before Altin returns{03}to its former glory.{02}{00}
#1902 No matter what happens,{03}I'd never abandon Altin.{02}{00}
#1903 Of course, our house will{03}be ruined now.{01}I wish I could{03}move away...{02}{00}
#1904 Leaving Altin for Tolbi?{03}Well, that's just crazy.{02}{00}
#1905 Now I finally have an{03}excuse to move to{03}my favorite town{18}Tolbi!{02}{00}
#1906 Not many people come up{03}Silk Road to Altin. You're{03}an odd one, you are.{02}{00}
#1907 It's been a long time{03}since I got a break{03}from doing housework.{02}{00}
#1908 Of course, you can't{03}go west of the mountains{03}without taking Silk Road.{02}{00}
#1909 I hate sitting around{03}like this. I want to{03}go home!{02}{00}
#190A It was after that eerie{03}night when the gems{03}fell from the sky.{01}That was when the{03}water-spewing beasts{03}appeared in the mine!{02}{00}
#190B Please save the helpless{03}in Altin...{02}{00}
#190C We did it, {11}{01}!{03}We beat the last{03}water beast!{02}{00}
#190D I wonder why Altin's{03}guardian statues turned{03}into monsters.{01}Isn't it strange?{1E}{00}
#190E And what's up with this{03}strange, tiled room at the{03}bottom of the mine?{02}{00}
#190F Oh, I'm sure you get{03}that sort of thing{03}all the time.{01}Still, it's strange that the{03}bottom of the mine was{03}made of carved stone.{02}{00}
#1910 The guardian statues{03}were created long,{03}long ago.{02}{00}
#1911 What are they for?{02}{00}
#1912 There's a treasure{03}chest behind the{03}guardian statue!{02}{00}
#1913 It must all be related{03}to these ruins, buried{03}deep in the mine...{02}{00}
#1914 I guess so... Hey, {11}{01},{03}we should check that{03}chest before we go!{02}{00}
#1915 In the hands of an Adept,{03}the Lifting Gem imparts{03}great power.{02}{00}
#1916 {11}{01} acquired{03}the Psynergy Lift.{02}{00}
#1917 Thank you so much for{03}defeating the hydros{03}statues in the mine.{02}{00}
#1918 Did you see water{03}gushing out when you slew{03}those hydros creatures?{1E}{00}
#1919 I see... So the water{03}monsters are like{03}giant water tanks...{02}{00}
#191A Really... Then how could{03}they have carried all{03}that water?{02}{00}
#191B Once the mine opens{03}again, we'll be able to{03}get back on our feet.{02}{00}
#191C They already started{03}mining the upper parts{03}of the mountain.{01}But people still seem{03}afraid to go down to{03}the lower depths.{02}{00}
#191D The water drained out of{03}the mine through all the{03}cracks, as I expected.{01}But the remaining water{03}will probably sit here{03}for a while.{02}{00}
#191E Thank goodness,{03}the village is free{03}from all that water.{02}{00}
#191F Are you the ones who{03}defeated the water{03}beasts?{1E}{00}
#1920 We'd be much obliged{03}if you'd also help{03}rebuild the village.{02}{00}
#1921 I heard our rescuers{03}were young. I'd like{03}to meet them.{02}{00}
#1922 The village went right{03}back to normal once{03}the water monsters left.{01}But it's still a mess{03}around here.{02}{00}
#1923 So those hydros creatures{03}really were the guardian{03}statues, huh?{01}That sure is a surprise.{02}{00}
#1924 Is it true you found{03}ancient ruins in the{03}deepest part of the mine?{1E}{00}
#1925 Really? I always thought{03}that mine held some{03}kind of secret.{02}{00}
#1926 Hmmm, are you sure you{03}even went down there?{01}Someone ought to{03}go check it out.{02}{00}
#1927 We can go back to{03}work in the{03}mines again.{02}{00}
#1928 I was afraid more water{03}would gush out when{03}the monsters were slain.{02}{00}
#1929 I hope Altin Mine will{03}thrive again soon,{03}like it once did.{02}{00}
#192A The water seeped into{03}the mine shafts.{01}I bet the rock is{03}very soft.{02}{00}
#192B It's so humid inside that{03}cave. It feels awful{03}and sticky in there!{02}{00}
#192C That strange chamber in{03}the mines creeps me out.{02}{00}
#192D You fought pretty well{03}despite all that foul water{03}the beasts spewed out.{02}{00}
#192E That mine is full of holes{03}and chasms. That's why{03}it drained so well.{02}{00}
#192F The old guardian statues{03}always creeped me out.{03}I'm glad they're gone.{02}{00}
#1930 I used to find all sorts{03}of artifacts. I wonder if{03}they came from the ruins.{02}{00}
#1931 I hear that Silk{03}Road is closed...{01}Or, at least, that's what{03}this girl from Xian said.{02}{00}
#1932 A girl from Xian was{03}asking questions about{03}young warriors.{01}Say, could she have{03}meant you guys?{1E}{00}
#1933 She was searching{03}very hard.{02}{00}
#1934 Well, if not, I hope she{03}finds whoever she was{03}looking for.{02}{00}
#1935 The merchants must be{03}having a hard time if{03}Silk Road is blocked.{01}Who could clear{03}away a landslide?{02}{00}
#1936 I wonder what business{03}that girl from Xian has{03}with warriors...{02}{00}
#1937 Ancient ruins and{03}treasure definitely go{03}together...{01}What are you going{03}to do?{02}{00}
#1938 If only they had left a{03}water monster or two...{02}{00}
#1939 They say you can still{03}find monsters if you go{03}deep enough in the mine.{01}I'd go treasure hunting{03}if it weren't for those{03}nasty beasts.{02}{00}
#193A How can I truly be{03}happy if all those cute{03}monsters are gone?{02}{00}
#193B Really? Ancient ruins at{03}the bottom of the{03}mine? You don't say...{02}{00}
#193C There probably isn't{03}much treasure in the{03}ruins beneath the mine.{01}Why don't you forget{03}about treasure and just{03}resume your journey?{02}{00}
#193D Something's wrong with{03}Mom and Pop. They've{03}been acting weird{01}ever since the ruins were{03}found in the mine.{02}{00}
#193E Cripes. Ancient ruins{03}down in the mine...{01}We have to go get that{03}treasure right away.{02}{00}
#193F I had no idea there were{03}ruins beneath the mine.{02}{00}
#1940 I wonder if Mom and Pop{03}knew about the monument{03}in the mine.{02}{00}
#1941 You'll have to find the{03}passage in the mine{03}that leads west{01}if Silk Road is blocked.{02}{00}
#1942 I've heard of a passage{03}in the mine that leads{03}west, but I've yet to meet{01}anyone who's found it.{02}{00}
#1943 How about it? Aren't you{03}impressed by our vast{03}armor selection?{02}{00}
#1944 Well, if you are{03}impressed, then make{03}a purchase!{02}{00}
#1945 The girl from Xian bought{03}a lot. I wonder if{03}she is on a journey.{02}{00}
#1946 The girl from Xian bought{03}all goods that had{03}been submerged.{02}{00}
#1947 There is a small temple{03}to the west of Altin Mine.{01}They may be having{03}trouble with the water{03}from the mine.{02}{00}
#1948 There is an endless{03}desert west of{03}the mountains.{01}Any travelers going{03}west must prepare{03}themselves well.{02}{00}
#1949 West of the mountains{03}is very{18}very hot!{03}It is exhausting!{01}Eating hot food is{03}good. It helps you{03}endure the heat.{02}{00}
#194A There are a few beasts in{03}the mine still, but they're{03}down deep below, right?{1E}{00}
#194B Good. Then we can just{03}mine the upper{03}passages.{02}{00}
#194C If they're in the upper{03}passages, then we can't{03}mine like we used to.{02}{00}
#194D I think that temple was{03}called Lama Temple.{01}There are said to be{03}people with strange{03}powers there.{02}{00}
#194E You won't be able to go{03}to the desert for a while{03}since Silk Road is blocked.{02}{00}
#194F No one can go west of{03}the mountains now.{02}{00}
#1950 It will take some time{03}before Altin recovers{03}from this.{02}{00}
#1951 You saved Altin from{03}the monsters.{01}Clearly this is the{03}work of the hand of Fate.{02}{00}
#1952 Almighty Fate must{03}have heard me.{02}{00}
#1953 Watch for falling rocks!{01}Do not strike the{03}wall! Rocks may fall!{02}{00}
#1954 Tch!{05} We came this deep{03}into the mine just to{03}find a dead end!{02}{00}
#1955 ...I have a bad feeling{03}about this. Run,{03}{11}{01}! Now!{02}{00}
#1956 He who has the power to see{03}that which cannot be seen{03}shall see the truth...{01}So reads the writing{03}on the wall.{02}{00}
#1957 This is Lama Temple.{03}Welcome, travelers.{01}The Lamakan Desert ahead{03}is a very hot land. Rest{03}well before you go.{02}{00}
#1958 Young warriors, do you{03}come from the east?{1E}{00}
#1959 Then you must have come{03}across Lamakan Desert...{02}{00}
#195A Did you stop in Xian{03}along the way?{1E}{00}
#195B Master Feh, in Xian, is{03}very close to our{03}Master Hama.{01}Students from Feh's{03}school often continue their{03}kung fu training here...{02}{00}
#195C Then it is good that{03}you have come here.{01}Feh's kung fu is good{03}for warriors who{03}seek to better themselves.{02}{00}
#195D Do you know what{03}meditation is?{1E}{00}
#195E It allows you to find{03}peace by closing{03}your eyes...{01}and sealing your{03}mind from the{03}world around you.{02}{00}
#195F It is training in which{03}you clear your mind of{03}all thought...{01}and try to become{03}as still and calm{03}as a stone.{02}{00}
#1960 You who speak to me...{03}I sense great insecurity{03}and anxiety within you.{02}{00}
#1961 Did you know that Master{03}Hama is the greatest{03}master of Chi?{1E}{00}
#1962 You do? Then you must{03}have already met Master{03}Feh in Xian, haven't you?{01}But Hama's power does{03}not end there.{02}{00}
#1963 Then today, you shall{03}see that Master Hama is{03}truly the master of Chi.{02}{00}
#1964 They seem to be anxious.{03}They cannot survive{03}the desert like that.{02}{00}
#1965 They say a person can{03}overcome any trial{03}once he masters kung fu.{02}{00}
#1966 .{05}.{05}.{05}.{05}.{05}.{05}{03}.{05}.{05}.{05}.{05}.{05}.{05}{03}I{05}{05}{05} am hungry...{02}{00}
#1967 I sense impure thoughts{03}from the man beside me...{03}His training is weak.{02}{00}
#1968 Chi is but a fragment of{03}Master Hama's power...{03}She is a true scholar.{02}{00}
#1969 Master Hama is{03}meditating. Please be{03}extremely quiet.{02}{00}
#196A So, {11}{01}, you and{03}your Adept companions{03}have finally come.{02}{00}
#196B Finally come?{03}Was she expecting us?{1E}{00}
#196C But how did she know{03}we'd be here now?{02}{00}
#196D Then, how come she knew{03}we were coming, {11}{01}?{03}{02}{00}
#196E I had{05} anticipated{05}{03}your arrival.{02}{00}
#196F You knew we were{03}coming, then?{02}{00}
#1970 I have been waiting a{03}long while for you.{01}You come seeking{03}the Elemental Stars.{02}{00}
#1971 You know about the{03}Elemental Stars, too?{03}Who...{05} Who are you?{02}{00}
#1972 I am a Jupiter Adept,{03}just like {11}{03}.{02}{00}
#1973 I'm not a Jupiter Adept!{03}What are you{03}talking about?{02}{00}
#1974 You are, {11}{03}, although{03}you may not yet know it.{02}{00}
#1975 Why do you say that?{02}{00}
#1976 Do you not have the{03}power to read minds?{02}{00}
#1977 This ability is unique{03}to the Jupiter Adepts.{02}{00}
#1978 You predicted our{03}coming... Is that{03}also{05} Psynergy?{02}{00}
#1979 Ho ho!{05} Excellent question,{03}Miss {11}{04}.{02}{00}
#197A Yes, the ability to foresee{03}events also belongs to{03}the Jupiter Adepts.{02}{00}
#197B Then, can {11}{03} learn the{03}power of prediction, too?{02}{00}
#197C He already has.{02}{00}
#197D I don't think I have{18}{02}{00}
#197E You do.{05} You merely do{03}not yet know that{03}you have it.{02}{00}
#197F The power of Jupiter{03}must be great if it{03}lets you see the future.{02}{00}
#1980 Oh, but {11}{03} can learn{03}to use an even{03}greater power!{02}{00}
#1981 What greater power?{02}{00}
#1982 Reveal.{02}{00}
#1983 Reveal?{02}{00}
#1984 Yes. I have waited long{03}to pass the power of{03}true sight on to you.{02}{00}
#1985 You waited here in Lama{03}Temple just to teach{03}Reveal to {11}{03}?{02}{00}
#1986 You will need Reveal{03}if you are to achieve{03}your goals...{02}{00}
#1987 Jupiter Adepts can learn{03}Reveal on their own,{03}over time...{02}{00}
#1988 But that power alone will{03}not help you find Saturos{03}as his company moves on.{02}{00}
#1989 It was Saturos and his{03}companions who blocked{03}Silk Road.{02}{00}
#198A {11}{05} and the rest{03}of them, huh?{05}{03}Those cowards!{02}{00}
#198B {11}{05} bears a terrible{03}fate, a burden I would{03}not wish on any man.{02}{00}
#198C A terrible fate?{03}What do you mean?{02}{00}
#198D I am sorry, but I can{03}say nothing more of{03}this matter.{02}{00}
#198E Now, we must focus on{03}the power of Reveal.{02}{00}
#198F You will need the power{03}of Reveal to cross the{03}evil Lamakan Desert.{02}{00}
#1990 An evil desert?{03}Is that even possible?{1E}{00}
#1991 You believe that, {11}{01}?{03}Well, I just don't buy it.{02}{00}
#1992 It's hard to believe,{03}isn't it, {11}{01}?{03}I feel the same way.{02}{00}
#1993 Why will we need Reveal{03}to cross the desert?{02}{00}
#1994 Crossing Lamakan Desert{03}was hard enough with{03}the extreme heat.{02}{00}
#1995 But evil has taken hold of{03}the desert, and its heat{03}has become unbearable.{02}{00}
#1996 Entering the desert now{03}is nothing short of{03}asking for death.{02}{00}
#1997 Then how can Saturos{03}cross such a deadly{03}place?{02}{00}
#1998 Saturos and Menardi{03}are Mars Adepts.{02}{00}
#1999 I am merely guessing...{01}but their powers might{03}help them suppress the{03}heat as they cross.{02}{00}
#199A I still don't understand...{03}How will Reveal help us{03}in such an evil place?{02}{00}
#199B Reveal will help you{03}find oases to cool you{03}against the heat.{02}{00}
#199C Why would we need{03}Reveal for that? Won't we{03}be able to see the oases?{02}{00}
#199D Do you know what{03}a mirage is?{1E}{00}
#199E The desert is filled with{03}mirages that prevent you{03}from seeing clearly.{01}Without Reveal, you{03}cannot find the oases.{02}{00}
#199F Intense heat creates{03}a curtain of air that{03}distorts the terrain.{01}Mirages will deceive your{03}eyes, preventing you from{03}finding any oases.{02}{00}
#19A0 Sounds like we should{03}have {11}{03} learn Reveal,{03}don't you think?{1E}{00}
#19A1 Yeah! I don't want to{03}die in any{03}evil desert!{02}{00}
#19A2 Oh, come on, {11}{01}!{03}If we're going to follow{03}{11}{05}, we'll need Reveal!{02}{00}
#19A3 {11}{03}, you should let{03}Master Hama teach you{03}how to use Reveal.{02}{00}
#19A4 What's wrong,{03}Master Hama?{01}You{05} can pass Reveal on{03}to me,{05} can't you?{02}{00}
#19A5 I am{05} unsure that{03}it will work.{02}{00}
#19A6 In preparation for{03}this day, I tried to{03}pass a power on{01}to a young girl,{03}although that power{03}was not Reveal.{02}{00}
#19A7 My student was{03}not an Adept...{02}{00}
#19A8 But I thought anyone could{03}hone a skill he or she{03}already possessed...{02}{00}
#19A9 However, I saw no{03}change in the girl.{02}{00}
#19AA No! There was change!{02}{00}
#19AB Feizhi... Why are{03}you here?{02}{00}
#19AC I sensed it!{02}{00}
#19AD Sensed it? What did{03}you sense?{02}{00}
#19AE Hsu is in great danger!{02}{00}
#19AF Hsu left this place{03}a long time ago.{02}{00}
#19B0 I know...{03}But Hsu did not{03}return to Xian.{02}{00}
#19B1 ...The boulders in the{03}mountains!{02}{00}
#19B2 I sensed it. I came{03}through the mine.{03}I came to ask for help.{02}{00}
#19B3 I sensed nothing, as I{03}was focused on {11}{01}'s{03}arrival...{02}{00}
#19B4 But{05} why has the power{03}come to you now, after{03}all this time?{02}{00}
#19B5 Gems fell from the sky.{03}One hit me right{03}on the head.{02}{00}
#19B6 Gems...{02}{00}
#19B7 Psynergy Stones...{02}{00}
#19B8 Then{05} this may work{03}after all.{02}{00}
#19B9 What about Hsu?{02}{00}
#19BA Let us hurry to{03}Hsu's aid!{02}{00}
#19BB Master Hama, what about{03}us? What about Reveal?{02}{00}
#19BC I had completely forgotten.{02}{00}
#19BD It seems I succeeded in{03}passing my power to{03}Feizhi. You will be fine.{02}{00}
#19BE This should do it.{03}Use Reveal to cross{03}the desert.{02}{00}
#19BF But your Reveal may not{03}be that strong yet...{03}The oases may not appear.{02}{00}
#19C0 The rest is up to{03}{11}{03}'s abilities.{02}{00}
#19C1 {11}{03}, I am very glad{03}to see you have grown to{03}be such a strong man.{02}{00}
#19C2 {11}{03}, do you and{03}Master Hama...{03}know each other?{02}{00}
#19C3 No... But she doesn't{03}feel like{05} a stranger...{02}{00}
#19C4 {11}{05} and the others{03}must be far ahead of{03}us by now...{1E}{00}
#19C5 Then we'd better get{03}moving! Let's go!{02}{00}
#19C6 The desert may have{03}slowed them down, but{03}we can't waste a second!{02}{00}
#19C7 We can't just{03}leave like this!{02}{00}
#19C8 Hama might need{03}our help...{02}{00}
#19C9 She only has Feizhi{03}to assist her.{03}Shouldn't we help, too?{1E}{00}
#19CA I'm more worried about{03}{11}{05} and the others...{01}But I'm not opposed{03}to rescuing Hsu.{02}{00}
#19CB I am worried about Feizhi{03}and Master Hama...{01}But I understand why{03}you want to chase{03}after {11}{05}.{02}{00}
#19CC We'll go with you, {11}{01},{03}whatever you decide!{02}{00}
#19CD I wonder what Master{03}Hama was talking about...{02}{00}
#19CE Oh, I'm sorry...{03}Let's go.{02}{00}
#19CF Hsu, are you okay?{02}{00}
#19D0 Master Hama, I am okay.{03}But the boulder...{03}I cannot move.{02}{00}
#19D1 Hsu seems unhurt.{03}You must be glad, Feizhi.{02}{00}
#19D2 Yes. Thank you, Master.{03}But how can we free him?{02}{00}
#19D3 I{05} don't know{03}what we can do.{02}{00}
#19D4 Well, {11}{01}! Adepts!{03}You came to help...{01}Hsu is in trouble,{03}as you can see.{03}What should we do?{02}{00}
#19D5 Be strong, Hsu!{03}We will help you!{02}{00}
#19D6 I am trapped between{03}these two boulders.{01}At least I wasn't{03}crushed. I was lucky.{02}{00}
#19D7 How should we move{03}the boulders?{02}{00}
#19D8 Hsu tires. He looks{03}exhausted.{03}I am worried!{02}{00}
#19D9 I want to scream.{03}But Feizhi does not{03}like it when I do that.{02}{00}
#19DA {11}{01}, did you lift{03}the boulder?{02}{00}
#19DB Oh my! The boulder!{03}It floats!{02}{00}
#19DC Quickly, Feizhi. We must{03}pull Hsu free!{02}{00}
#19DD Ready yourself, Hsu.{03}I am going to pull.{03}One, two, three!{02}{00}
#19DE He is halfway out.{03}Just a little further.{02}{00}
#19DF Can you hang on just{03}a moment longer, {11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#19E0 Thank you, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#19E1 You cannot back out now!{03}You must be responsible!{02}{00}
#19E2 Ready? I am going to pull!{03}One, two, three!{02}{00}
#19E3 We did it! Master Hama,{03}Hsu is free!{02}{00}
#19E4 We did it, Feizhi!{02}{00}
#19E5 Thank you, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#19E6 We must contact Master{03}Feh and ask him to tend{03}to Hsu's injuries.{02}{00}
#19E7 I will ask him to clean{03}up the rocks, too.{02}{00}
#19E8 Excellent. If Silk Road{03}remains blocked,{03}everyone will suffer.{02}{00}
#19E9 Adepts, let me thank you{03}again. I am{03}truly grateful.{02}{00}
#19EA I did not expect you{03}to come and aid us.{02}{00}
#19EB No, Master Hama...{03}We are the ones who{03}should be grateful.{02}{00}
#19EC Thank you for passing{03}the power of Reveal on{03}to me...{01}But{05} what you said...{02}{00}
#19ED What is it, {11}{03}?{02}{00}
#19EE Well, really, I was the{03}one who suggested we{03}help you,{05} right?{1E}{00}
#19EF What? Didn't you want{03}us to hurry on to the{03}desert, {11}{02}?{02}{00}
#19F0 Did I, {11}{04}? Did I really?{03}I think you must be{05}{03}mistaken. Yeah, that's it!{02}{00}
#19F1 No, {11}{02}...{03}You wanted us{03}to get moving!{02}{00}
#19F2 {11}{01}, {11}{04}...{03}Don't make me look{03}like a fool...{02}{00}
#19F3 Do not worry, {11}{02}.{03}I do not mind.{02}{00}
#19F4 Travel well, my friends.{02}{00}
#19F5 I hope to see{03}you soon.{02}{00}
#19F6 Weren't you going to ask{03}Master Hama what she{03}meant earlier?{02}{00}
#19F7 We do not know when we{03}will be able to see{03}Master Hama again.{02}{00}
#19F8 {11}{01}, don't you think{03}we should ask Master{03}Hama what she meant?{1E}{00}
#19F9 See? If it's bothering{03}you, you should just go{03}ahead and ask now!{02}{00}
#19FA Huh? You think we should{03}just leave it as is?{02}{00}
#19FB Thank you, everyone...{02}{00}
#19FC but it is better{03}that we leave now.{02}{00}
#19FD What do you mean?{02}{00}
#19FE Master Hama hasn't{03}looked me in the eye since{03}she said those words.{02}{00}
#19FF Well, that just makes{03}me even more curious!{02}{00}
#1A00 Don't worry about it.{03}I doubt she would even{03}tell me if I asked.{02}{00}
#1A01 Well, that's just...{02}{00}
#1A02 Master Hama will{03}tell me when we have{03}completed our mission.{02}{00}
#1A03 I have to believe that...{02}{00}
#1A04 It is very dangerous to{03}cross Lamakan Desert.{03}Be very careful!{02}{00}
#1A05 The evil desert is hotter{03}than the sun itself.{03}Look for oases!{02}{00}
#1A06 I believe it is possible{03}to learn the power of{03}prediction by meditating.{02}{00}
#1A07 I will be most thankful{03}once the evil desert{03}returns to normal.{02}{00}
#1A08 When your temperature{03}reaches its maximum,{01}you will take{03}tremendous damage.{01}Go quickly, and find{03}yourselves an oasis{03}when you get too hot.{02}{00}
#1A09 Master Hama is{03}meditating, asking for{03}your safety.{02}{00}
#1A0A The future holds many{03}hardships, but you must{03}not give up the fight.{02}{00}
#1A0B I cannot cross the{03}desert. It is too{03}fearsome for me.{02}{00}
#1A0C The evil in the desert{03}distorts all{18}even light.{03}What could be the cause?{02}{00}
#1A0D How nice it would be{03}if I could see the{03}future.{02}{00}
#1A0E Master Hama will be very{03}sad if you are lost{03}in the desert.{02}{00}
#1A0F With Reveal, you will find{03}oases with your mind,{03}not with your eyes.{02}{00}
#1A10 I do not think Master{03}Hama wants {11}{03} to go...{02}{00}
#1A11 I cannot see your{03}future clearly...{01}It must be because{03}I cannot be impartial{03}to it...or to you.{02}{00}
#1A12 North: Altin Mine{03}West: Lama Temple{02}{00}
#1A13 Agh...{05} This desert is much{03}hotter than I ever{03}imagined...{02}{00}
#1A14 Just walking around{03}here saps every{03}ounce of my strength.{02}{00}
#1A15 I can't stop sweating...{05}{03}I wish I'd brought{03}a change of clothes...{02}{00}
#1A16 I'm so thirsty...{05} Water!{05}{03}I need some water!{02}{00}
#1A17 I can't keep my cool{03}when it's this hot...{02}{00}
#1A18 Ew... My clothes are{03}drenched in sweat!{03}This is gross!{02}{00}
#1A19 Aghh!{05} I can't stand it!{05}{03}My feet are burning!{02}{00}
#1A1A I can't stand another{03}minute of this!{03}Where's an oasis?{02}{00}
#1A1B If we don't find an{03}oasis soon, I'm gonna{03}shrivel up and blow away!{02}{00}
#1A1C I'm traveling around{03}the world to spread{03}good will.{02}{00}
#1A1D Since I'm here, I'd like{03}to learn the secrets{03}of Fuchin Temple,{01}but that won't happen{03}unless I undergo{03}intense training.{02}{00}
#1A1E I am traveling around{03}the world to spread{03}good will.{02}{00}
#1A1F For some reason, these{03}people give me the{03}same feeling I got{01}from the master of{03}the temple, Master Hama.{01}Yes... I feel as though{03}my mind is being{03}read somehow...{02}{00}
#1A20 We moved the rocks.{03}Now people can pass.{02}{00}
#1A21 Many people from Xian{03}helped move the rocks.{03}They were very heavy!{02}{00}
#1A22 We cleared the way.{03}But what about these{03}rocks? Must we{01}clear these?{02}{00}
#1A23 I almost hurt my back.{03}It is because I have{03}not been training.{02}{00}
#1A24 Xian is a peaceful{03}village, but we have had{03}trouble lately.{01}Hsu is Master Feh's{03}apprentice. He was{03}trapped under a boulder.{02}{00}
#1A25 There was a rockslide on{03}Silk Road. It had{03}us all in shock.{02}{00}
#1A26 I went to help move{03}boulders...{03}Now, my back hurts.{02}{00}
#1A27 The people who cleared{03}the rockslide told me{03}Lamakan Desert is red.{01}Why is it red?{02}{00}
#1A28 Hsu is very good at{03}kung fu, but boulders are{03}very hard.{01}Kung fu is no good{03}against boulders.{02}{00}
#1A29 The people of Xian love{03}their village. They almost{03}never leave it.{01}But everyone left town{03}to help clear the rocks{03}off Silk Road.{02}{00}
#1A2A Altin was flooded with{03}water, but young warriors{03}fixed it. Feizhi said so.{02}{00}
#1A2B We cleared the rocks{03}from Silk Road. It was{03}very hard work.{02}{00}
#1A2C Many strange things{03}happened all at once.{03}What is going on?{02}{00}
#1A2D Hsu was caught under{03}a boulder, but he only{03}broke one leg.{02}{00}
#1A2E The rocks there were{03}very hard. Why did they{03}fall? It seems strange.{02}{00}
#1A2F Some people did not carry{03}rocks. I thought we{03}would cooperate.{01}I was foolish.{02}{00}
#1A30 Sand is the color of{03}the camel. Red sand{03}is very strange.{02}{00}
#1A31 Hsu is strong-headed.{03}He would not run from{03}falling boulders.{01}That is what happened.{02}{00}
#1A32 Everyone stays in Xian.{03}They do not know about{03}the outside world.{02}{00}
#1A33 This warrior saved Altin{03}village, no?{02}{00}
#1A34 It is bad for Xian if{03}rocks stay there.{01}Caravans cannot pass.{03}Silk merchants cannot{03}come to Xian.{02}{00}
#1A35 I was happy to see{03}gems falling from the sky,{03}but it was very strange.{01}I could sense bad{03}things coming.{02}{00}
#1A36 Where are the merchants?{03}No one comes. I hope{03}they come buy silk.{02}{00}
#1A37 Merchants bring us coins.{03}They must bring{03}them soon.{01}We need them to buy{03}food for winter.{02}{00}
#1A38 Why does Master Hammet{03}not come? We need him.{02}{00}
#1A39 Merchants sell silk. It is{03}like a carnival. It{03}will be sad to miss it.{02}{00}
#1A3A Is something wrong on{03}Silk Road? In Lamakan{03}Desert, too?{1E}{00}
#1A3B That is terrible. No one{03}can use Silk Road!{02}{00}
#1A3C The desert is fine?{03}That is good to hear.{02}{00}
#1A3D None can pass through{03}Lamakan. This is very,{03}very sad.{02}{00}
#1A3E Feizhi said the desert{03}became evil.{02}{00}
#1A3F The desert was very hot.{03}Now it is hotter...{03}No one can survive it.{02}{00}
#1A40 Did the monsters in{03}Altin spit water?{1E}{00}
#1A41 The town was flooded by{03}monsters? That takes{03}much water. How strange!{02}{00}
#1A42 It is not true?{03}But why would Feizhi lie?{02}{00}
#1A43 The mine in Altin filled{03}with water. I wanted{03}to see it.{02}{00}
#1A44 The village is flooded?{03}Because of monsters?{01}I am very confused...{02}{00}
#1A45 Water monsters... How{03}terrible for Altin.{01}But Xian has Master Feh.{03}He will defeat them.{02}{00}
#1A46 Hsu's injury taught a{03}good lesson.{01}Even kung fu is no{03}good against boulders.{02}{00}
#1A47 Hsu was pummeled by{03}huge boulders. His{03}injuries are not serious.{01}Kung fu helped him.{02}{00}
#1A48 Kung fu makes you quick,{03}does it not?{01}Even so, Hsu could not{03}outrun the falling rocks.{02}{00}
#1A49 We should sell armor{03}to kung fu masters,{03}as well.{02}{00}
#1A4A Do you plan to cross{03}the desert, warrior?{1E}{00}
#1A4B It will take much{03}strength. Perhaps you{03}should buy many supplies.{02}{00}
#1A4C You are wise, warrior.{03}The wise man knows to{03}avoid danger.{02}{00}
#1A4D You lose strength in heat.{03}Use my goods to recover{03}your strength.{02}{00}
#1A4E We have few customers{03}these days.{01}Customers can't come{03}if Silk Road is{03}completely blocked.{02}{00}
#1A4F When Lamakan Desert{03}burns, it is bad{03}for Xian.{01}Xian cannot sell silk.{03}The villagers cannot{03}survive winter.{02}{00}
#1A50 Hot food is good for{03}crossing Lamakan Desert.{01}Hot food brings back{03}your appetite.{02}{00}
#1A51 Caravans cannot bring{03}merchants here when{03}boulders block the road.{02}{00}
#1A52 The merchants do not{03}come, because the Lamakan{03}Desert burns.{01}It is bad for business.{02}{00}
#1A53 Eat, warrior. I will add{03}many hot peppers and{03}savory spices.{02}{00}
#1A54 Mogall Prairie is now a{03}forest, and Lamakan is{03}an evil desert.{01}We cannot go anywhere{03}from here now.{02}{00}
#1A55 If I cannot go east or{03}west, I will have to stay{03}in Xian until I die.{02}{00}
#1A56 This is Master Feh's{03}kung fu school.{01}Studying martial arts{03}keeps Xian peaceful.{02}{00}
#1A57 Boulders overcame Hsu.{03}Kung fu should never{03}be overcome.{01}We have to practice more.{02}{00}
#1A58 Water monsters flooded{03}Altin. Did you defeat{03}them, warrior?{1E}{00}
#1A59 You are much stronger{03}than you look, warrior.{01}I have much respect{03}for you now.{02}{00}
#1A5A Oh... You are not the{03}strong warrior Feizhi{03}spoke of?{02}{00}
#1A5B Hsu did not practice{03}jumping enough.{01}He could have dodged{03}boulders by jumping.{02}{00}
#1A5C Feizhi predicted Hsu's{03}danger. Her prophecy{03}came true...{01}That saved Hsu. Now{03}he has returned.{03}It is quite odd.{02}{00}
#1A5D Hsu is resting. Feizhi{03}is watching over him. They{03}will be glad to see you.{02}{00}
#1A5E Peace has returned to{03}Xian, but danger still{03}lurks both east and west.{02}{00}
#1A5F No matter how much you{03}practice your kicks,{01}your feet will never{03}be harder than a boulder.{02}{00}
#1A60 The monsters are very{03}large. Striking one would{03}hurt your hand.{01}Should we train with{03}weapons, perhaps?{02}{00}
#1A61 When a boulder falls,{03}jump. Repeat as needed.{03}That is all it takes.{02}{00}
#1A62 Where did Feizhi gain the{03}power to foresee trouble?{03}I want it, too.{02}{00}
#1A63 Master Feh is very{03}worried about{03}those two.{02}{00}
#1A64 Oh, warrior! Welcome!{02}{00}
#1A65 Hsu was saved, thanks{03}to you and Master Hama.{01}You have my deepest{03}gratitude.{02}{00}
#1A66 I was injured by rocks{03}on my way from{03}Lama Temple.{01}I am sad my training{03}could not help me.{02}{00}
#1A67 Feizhi's prediction{03}came true.{01}Now, I believe she{03}can foresee things.{02}{00}
#1A68 Master Hama has great{03}power. You do, too,{03}young warrior.{01}You are both amazing.{02}{00}
#1A69 I knew help would come{03}when I was trapped.{03}I must thank everyone.{02}{00}
#1A6A Feizhi's ability to sense{03}trouble is real. I am{03}quite surprised.{02}{00}
#1A6B Hsu was trapped under{03}the rocks, but he was{03}all right.{01}We have Master Hama to{03}thank for that.{02}{00}
#1A6C I was injured by boulders{03}on my way from{03}Lama Temple.{01}I am sad my training{03}could not help me.{02}{00}
#1A6D Feizhi's prediction{03}came true.{01}Now, I believe she{03}can foresee things.{02}{00}
#1A6E Master Hama has great{03}power. Some was passed{03}on to me.{01}I am quite happy.{02}{00}
#1A6F I knew help would come{03}when I was trapped.{03}I must thank everyone.{02}{00}
#1A70 Feizhi's ability to foresee{03}is real. I am{03}quite surprised.{02}{00}
#1A71 Welcome to Kalay! You{03}may enter, so long as you{03}do not disrupt the peace.{02}{00}
#1A72 We soldiers protect{03}the peace in Kalay with{03}our lives.{02}{00}
#1A73 Lord Hammet, the{03}founder of Kalay, is a{03}great merchant.{02}{00}
#1A74 Lord Hammet is still out{03}with his caravans{03}on business.{01}I wonder where he{03}could be now.{02}{00}
#1A75 The bridge to the north{03}was destroyed by lava.{01}Thankfully, it has been{03}rebuilt since then.{02}{00}
#1A76 I heard a rumor that{03}there's trouble in{03}Lamakan Desert.{02}{00}
#1A77 Kalay sits at a great{03}crossroads. Xian lies{03}east, and Tolbi west.{01}This is the perfect{03}place to do business.{02}{00}
#1A78 The guests at the inn{03}are tourists on their{03}way to see Colosso.{01}It seems like a lot of{03}hassle to travel to Tolbi{03}just for a carnival.{02}{00}
#1A79 I hear Colosso is{03}incredible. I'd love to see{03}such a huge carnival.{02}{00}
#1A7A A huge mountain north{03}of the river erupted{03}violently.{01}I think it was{03}called Mt. Aleph.{02}{00}
#1A7B Lord Hammet's knack for{03}business is the reason{03}Kalay has flourished.{02}{00}
#1A7C I came to Kalay because{03}I didn't like Tolbi...{03}You want to know why?{1E}{00}
#1A7D Because Babi, the ruler{03}of Tolbi, frightens me.{01}He has ruled Tolbi for{03}more than a hundred{03}years, they say.{02}{00}
#1A7E Kalay is a much better{03}town than Tolbi.{03}I won't go back.{02}{00}
#1A7F I can't put the rumors{03}about Lord Hammet being{03}captured by thieves{01}out of my head... But the{03}lord's wife, Layana,{03}speaks little of it.{02}{00}
#1A80 People say Lord Hammet{03}went north from Vault{03}after Mt. Aleph erupted.{01}No one knows what{03}happened to him or his{03}caravan after that.{02}{00}
#1A81 Hmm... This young warrior{03}has honest eyes and a{03}good demeanor.{01}A man like that is{03}never evil.{02}{00}
#1A82 Our job requires us to{03}judge whether to allow{03}a visitor into Kalay.{02}{00}
#1A83 Lord Hammet's love for{03}liberty and peace gave{03}birth to this town.{02}{00}
#1A84 Despite his appearance,{03}Lord Hammet can be{03}very rash.{01}That's why I'm worried.{02}{00}
#1A85 Lord Hammet's soldiers{03}went to Vault after{03}the bridge was rebuilt.{01}The palace has been{03}very quiet ever since...{02}{00}
#1A86 Strange things have been{03}happening all across the{03}land lately...{01}What is the{03}world coming to?{02}{00}
#1A87 Hammet chose to build{03}Kalay here because it's in{03}a prime trading location.{01}Lord Hammet truly is{03}a smart man.{02}{00}
#1A88 Actually... I wish I{03}were going to Colosso.{01}I should have saved{03}my money. Then I'd be{03}on that tour, too.{02}{00}
#1A89 Maybe when I'm older,{03}I'll even get to go{03}fight in Colosso!{02}{00}
#1A8A During the volcano's{03}eruption, odd gems and{03}rocks fell from the sky.{02}{00}
#1A8B Lord Hammet is a very{03}honest man, who values{03}trust above all.{01}That's probably why{03}he's so respected.{02}{00}
#1A8C The difference between{03}Kalay and Tolbi{03}is their leaders.{01}Lord Hammet rules with{03}trust, while Lord Babi{03}rules with force.{02}{00}
#1A8D I had no idea that Lunpa{03}was just north of Vault.{01}It's funny that a city{03}of merchants would be so{03}close to a city of thieves.{02}{00}
#1A8E There are so many{03}rumors now, no one knows{03}what the truth is.{02}{00}
#1A8F You can live in peace in{03}Kalay, as long as you{03}practice good will.{02}{00}
#1A90 I came here to spread{03}good will...{01}But Lord Hammet seems{03}to be the source of all{03}their good will.{01}This is not good...{02}{00}
#1A91 OK!{05} Are we all{03}listening? Let's stop{03}right here.{02}{00}
#1A92 Why are we stopping{03}at a place like this?{02}{00}
#1A93 Yeah!{05} We have to hurry,{03}or we'll be late{03}for Colosso!{02}{00}
#1A94 Late for Colosso?{03}We can't have that!{02}{00}
#1A95 That won't do at all!{02}{00}
#1A96 We paid good money to{03}see Colosso!{03}We can't be late!{02}{00}
#1A97 Everything will be just{03}fine, folks!{02}{00}
#1A98 We're just checking{03}to make sure no one{03}is missing!{02}{00}
#1A99 Well, I guess that's OK...{02}{00}
#1A9A But if anyone is{03}missing, we're the one's{03}who'll miss out.{02}{00}
#1A9B Forget about them!{03}Let's just get a move on!{02}{00}
#1A9C Oh, dear...{02}{00}
#1A9D All right, hurry up{03}and start counting!{02}{00}
#1A9E Uh-oh... We're short one{03}person... Now where{03}could he be?{02}{00}
#1A9F What's going on?{03}Why aren't we leaving{03}for Tolbi yet?{02}{00}
#1AA0 There are a lot of{03}people waiting to see{03}Colosso, here!{02}{00}
#1AA1 Hey? What's up? Why are{03}the guides pacing{03}back and forth?{02}{00}
#1AA2 We have to decide if{03}we're entering Colosso{03}once we reach Tolbi.{02}{00}
#1AA3 I hear there was a{03}landslide on the road{03}to Tolbi.{01}We paid good money to{03}take this cruise to{03}see Colosso!{02}{00}
#1AA4 Come on! Why aren't{03}we leaving yet?{02}{00}
#1AA5 Right when we're leaving,{03}they tell us we have{03}to ride a boat?{01}I can't stand boats...{05}{03}If I had known,{03}I never would have come.{02}{00}
#1AA6 It's just a shame a{03}man like you can't ride{03}on a boat, Ouranos.{02}{00}
#1AA7 That's odd. No matter{03}how many times I count,{03}we're still one short.{02}{00}
#1AA8 I counted everyone at{03}the inn... So where{03}did we lose him?{02}{00}
#1AA9 Who's missing? Come on,{03}we're all waiting!{02}{00}
#1AAA There are a lot of{03}people taking the tour{03}to Tolbi this year.{02}{00}
#1AAB Can't we just forget{03}about that missing guy{03}and get moving!?{02}{00}
#1AAC With so many going to{03}Tolbi, I'm sure a few of{03}them are entering Colosso.{02}{00}
#1AAD I'm a little worried, with{03}all these strange things{03}happening everywhere!{02}{00}
#1AAE This an embarassment!{03}Waiting around after{03}announcing we're leaving!{02}{00}
#1AAF I'm embarrassed to say{03}this, but I can't swim.{01}What am I going to do{03}if the boat capsizes...{02}{00}
#1AB0 That's why I've been{03}telling you I'd teach{03}you how to swim...{02}{00}
#1AB1 Maybe I should go check{03}and see if he's still at{03}the inn. What should I do?{02}{00}
#1AB2 That's it... {05}We can't{03}wait any longer!{02}{00}
#1AB3 Can't wait? What do{03}you mean?{02}{00}
#1AB4 We all knew that anyone{03}who was late would be{03}left behind, right?{02}{00}
#1AB5 Everyone understood that.{02}{00}
#1AB6 Then what's the problem?{05}{03}We'll miss the boat if{03}we wait any longer!{02}{00}
#1AB7 Miss the boat?{05}{03}We can't let that happen!{02}{00}
#1AB8 We paid a lot of money...{01}We have to arrive{03}before the{03}carnival starts!{02}{00}
#1AB9 There's nothing we can{03}do...{05}{05} Let's go!{02}{00}
#1ABA Yeah! Let's go!{02}{00}
#1ABB OK...{05} Follow me, and{03}stay in line!{02}{00}
#1ABC Hmm... {05}Now where did my{03}tour group get to...?{02}{00}
#1ABD No! They wouldn't have{03}left without me{05}{05},{03}would they?{02}{00}
#1ABE Oh, no! I'd better{03}get moving!{02}{00}
#1ABF I'm shocked to hear the{03}righteous thieves of{03}Lunpa have gone bad.{01}They say Lunpa's grandson{03}is responsible for it.{02}{00}
#1AC0 Lunpa was a kind thief.{03}His son is Donpa{18}he's{03}an honorable thief, too.{01}He stole, but he was{03}just. Lunpa's grandson,{03}Dodonpa, is another story.{01}He doesn't even{03}think twice about{03}doing evil...{02}{00}
#1AC1 The region north of Vault{03}was once a safe place...{01}but nowadays it is{03}very dangerous.{02}{00}
#1AC2 Lunpa's reputation is{03}very bad nowadays.{02}{00}
#1AC3 Somehow, the north has{03}become the center of{03}much attention lately.{01}Why is that?{02}{00}
#1AC4 A merchant from Vault{03}had been saying many{03}things about the north...{01}Then the soldiers came{03}and took him to{03}Lord Hammet's Palace.{02}{00}
#1AC5 Three years ago, thieves{03}raided Mt. Aleph...{03}It was quite a story.{01}Ever since, the north{03}lost its reputation for{03}being a safe place.{02}{00}
#1AC6 They say other northern{03}parts are dangerous too.{01}Maybe our town is the{03}only place that's{03}still safe.{02}{00}
#1AC7 No one is allowed to go{03}to Vault, even though the{03}bridge has been rebuilt.{01}But I doubt it's{03}because of the eruption{03}of Mt. Aleph.{02}{00}
#1AC8 I do not want my son{03}to face any danger.{01}I am actually grateful{03}for Lady Layana's orders.{02}{00}
#1AC9 I'm an adult, now.{03}I don't want my father{03}ordering me around...{02}{00}
#1ACA I don't care how my son{03}feels. I can't allow{03}him to go north.{02}{00}
#1ACB The most important skill{03}for a merchant is the{03}ability to discern quality.{01}Anyone who can do that{03}can be a successful{03}merchant these days.{02}{00}
#1ACC My son received his{03}knack for business from{03}Lord Hammet.{02}{00}
#1ACD The most important thing{03}is not to betray your{03}customer's trust in you.{01}Lord Hammet's lessons are{03}more precious to me{03}than treasure.{01}They will make me a{03}lot of money!{02}{00}
#1ACE My son is very tight{03}with money, even when it{03}comes to me.{01}I feel like I am living{03}with a merchant...{03}Actually, he is one!{02}{00}
#1ACF Lord Hammet sells all{03}his best weapons{03}elsewhere.{01}These weapons are good,{03}but they're not the{03}best Kalay makes.{02}{00}
#1AD0 We would be able to make{03}more money if he left{03}more good weapons here.{02}{00}
#1AD1 Did you find what you{03}needed in the{03}Weapon Shop?{1E}{00}
#1AD2 Then you'll like our{03}armor, too.{02}{00}
#1AD3 Ah...{05} You seek only{03}the finest items.{01}Kalay's weapons and{03}armor are without equal.{02}{00}
#1AD4 Weapons and armor from{03}Tolbi may be stronger, but{03}ours have soul.{02}{00}
#1AD5 Lady Layana shared in{03}Lord Hammet's hardships{03}when he built Kalay.{01}Her love for this town{03}is why we flourish.{02}{00}
#1AD6 The aqueducts in Hammet{03}Palace are another reason{03}Kalay flourished.{02}{00}
#1AD7 Are you going to{03}Tolbi also?{1E}{00}
#1AD8 Oh, so you must be{03}taking the Colosso{03}tour, too...{01}The annual Colosso{03}festival starts in{03}Tolbi soon.{02}{00}
#1AD9 Merchants are always{03}coming up with new ideas.{03}A Colosso tour... Ha!{01}They're meeting in the{03}restaurant... It must be{03}time for them to leave.{02}{00}
#1ADA Everyone is going to{03}Tolbi to see the Colosso{03}carnival there.{01}Kalay will feel so empty.{02}{00}
#1ADB I've signed on for{03}a tour group going{03}to Tolbi.{01}I can't believe it's{03}almost time for Colosso{03}to begin!{02}{00}
#1ADC The Colosso gladiators{03}are all strong, muscular{03}men!{02}{00}
#1ADD Please finish eating if you{03}are taking the tour!{05}{03}We'll be leaving soon!{02}{00}
#1ADE Everyone looks forward{03}to going to Tolbi{03}once a year.{01}Tolbi has many spots{03}to visit besides Colosso,{03}like Tolbi Springs.{02}{00}
#1ADF Surely Lord Hammet will{03}pop up in Tolbi.{01}He loves Colosso.{02}{00}
#1AE0 I would have entered{03}Colosso if I were only{03}a little younger.{01}What a shame.{02}{00}
#1AE1 Many of the guests here{03}seem to be heading to{03}Tolbi.{02}{00}
#1AE2 Aren't you going to{03}Colosso? You guys are{03}warriors!{01}All warriors dream{03}of winning fame in{03}Colosso!{02}{00}
#1AE3 Do you know about the{03}continent south of Tolbi?{1E}{00}
#1AE4 The guest next door{03}is dressed like he comes{03}from Gondowan.{02}{00}
#1AE5 That continent is called{03}Gondowan. It is very{03}large.{01}They say that it is the{03}second largest continent{03}next to Angara.{01}I hear it is very{03}warm in Gondowan.{02}{00}
#1AE6 I better get ready!{03}The Colosso Tour{03}is about to leave!{01}We're going all the{03}way to Tolbi to see the{03}Colosso.{01}I hope we can visit the{03}southern continent, too.{02}{00}
#1AE7 We fled from Gondowan,{03}to the south.{01}We lived in Lalivero,{03}which was a great village{03}until the Tolbians came.{02}{00}
#1AE8 Lalivero, where I'm from,{03}is the largest village{03}in Gondowan.{01}Kalay is quite large, too,{03}but it's a little too{03}noisy around here.{02}{00}
#1AE9 If you are entering{03}Colosso{05}, you don't stand{03}a chance of winning...{01}because this year, both{03}of us are entering.{02}{00}
#1AEA We're so strong, making{03}the finals will be{03}a piece of cake!{01}Then, Ouranos and I will{03}fight each other for{03}the championship.{02}{00}
#1AEB He's a shrewd merchant{03}if he can turn travel{03}into a business.{01}I'm impressed that he's{03}got so many customers.{02}{00}
#1AEC Every year, everyone{03}goes to Tolbi for Colosso.{03}We can't help that...{02}{00}
#1AED Joining a tour group is{03}the only way to travel.{03}Every need is cared for.{02}{00}
#1AEE I wonder which warrior{03}will win Colosso this year.{03}I can't wait!{02}{00}
#1AEF It's business, so you{03}can't help it, but{03}many of these folk{01}aren't used to{03}traveling.{02}{00}
#1AF0 I'm exhausted from{03}preparing this tour.{01}I can't wait until I'm{03}in Tolbi and I can{03}rest a bit...{02}{00}
#1AF1 I was so excited, I{03}couldn't sleep last night.{03}But I have to keep cool.{01}I don't want anyone to{03}know this is my{03}first time at Colosso.{02}{00}
#1AF2 My animal instincts start{03}waking up as soon as{03}I see the Colosso battles!{02}{00}
#1AF3 Colosso is so...common.{03}What's so great about it?{02}{00}
#1AF4 I'm going to sign up for{03}Colosso as soon as I{03}arrive in Tolbi.{01}There may be more{03}like me, though.{02}{00}
#1AF5 People from the continent{03}south of Angara have{03}rich, bronze skin.{02}{00}
#1AF6 I'm pretty excited,{03}because this is my first{03}time visiting Tolbi.{01}Let's hurry up and{03}get going!{02}{00}
#1AF7 I fled all this way. Now I{03}won't get in trouble{03}for speaking the truth.{01}How wonderful it is{03}to be free!{02}{00}
#1AF8 It looks like{03}Colosso will soon{03}begin in Tolbi.{01}All this fuss just{03}to go to a festival seems{03}kind of ridiculous!{02}{00}
#1AF9 I have power, and Sean{03}has speed. Together, we{03}have nothing to fear.{02}{00}
#1AFA We are the toughest of{03}all warriors. We will{03}never lose.{02}{00}
#1AFB Our inn feels so empty,{03}now that the Colosso{03}tour group has left.{02}{00}
#1AFC Even our chef left, so{03}we can't keep our{03}business open.{01}Not that it matters. We{03}will have few customers{03}until Colosso ends.{02}{00}
#1AFD Uh-oh.{05} He's still here,{03}even though his group{03}has left!{02}{00}
#1AFE We came here to escape{03}the southern lands, but{03}this city is so strange.{01}Everyone is leaving for{03}some carnival. I've never{03}seen anything like it!{02}{00}
#1AFF We escaped from the{03}northeastern region of the{03}southern continent.{01}It is so quiet here{03}now that everyone left...{03}I feel relieved.{02}{00}
#1B00 I'd have gone on the{03}Colosso Tour if I knew{03}business would be so slow.{02}{00}
#1B01 Even if my husband{03}wanted to go on the{03}Colosso tour, I would{01}never let him. There's no{03}telling what he'd do{03}without me watching him.{02}{00}
#1B02 I can't seem to relax, now{03}that everyone is gone.{03}Maybe I should go back...{02}{00}
#1B03 I wonder what Colosso{03}is like. Is it really{03}that great?{01}Wait...{05} I didn't flee{03}Lalivero to go to Tolbi.{02}{00}
#1B04 I was so scared coming{03}to Angara from Gondowan,{03}where Lalivero is.{01}Now I'm beginning to feel{03}like I am truly free.{02}{00}
#1B05 This is Lord Hammet's{03}palace.{05} The lord is away.{03}Please, begone.{02}{00}
#1B06 We will happily welcome{03}visitors once Lord{03}Hammet has returned.{02}{00}
#1B07 Leave this to me.{02}{00}
#1B08 It is I... {05} Please permit{03}me to see Lady Layana.{02}{00}
#1B09 Don't you recognize me?{05}{03}I am {11}{03}, servant{03}to Lord Hammet!{02}{00}
#1B0A {11}{03}...{05}?{02}{00}
#1B0B I didn't recognize you{18}{03}You're so tan!{03}But it really is you, {11}{03}!{02}{00}
#1B0C Oh, it's {11}{03}!{05} You've{03}grown so much in such a{03}short time, {11}{03}!{02}{00}
#1B0D Have I really changed{03}that much?{1E}{00}
#1B0E Really?{05} I'm surprised...{03}It doesn't feel like{03}it's been that long...{02}{00}
#1B0F You probably wouldn't{03}know. You only met me{03}after I got left in Vault.{02}{00}
#1B10 That doesn't matter...{03}What's important is that{03}the thieves freed you!{02}{00}
#1B11 Please tell us,{03}will Lord Hammet be{03}freed soon, too?{02}{00}
#1B12 Freed?{03}Lord Hammet is{03}a prisoner?{02}{00}
#1B13 .{05}.{05}.{05}You haven't heard?{03}I can see we'll need to{03}fill you in on everything.{01}This is a private matter.{03}Would your friends{03}please leave?{1E}{00}
#1B14 No, {11}{01}! There{03}are no secrets{03}between us!{02}{00}
#1B15 My companions and I{03}have overcome many{03}hardships together!{02}{00}
#1B16 Very well, then...{03}Why were you not{03}with Lord Hammet?{02}{00}
#1B17 I remained in Vault to{03}look for his stolen rod.{02}{00}
#1B18 Stolen?{03}Someone stole his rod?{02}{00}
#1B19 Yes, the Shaman's Rod.{05}{03}But I was able to{03}recover it...{02}{00}
#1B1A Then Lord Hammet must{03}still be imprisoned{03}in Lunpa...{02}{00}
#1B1B I must report this{03}to Lady Layana!{02}{00}
#1B1C {11}{03}, come see Lady{03}Layana with me... You can{03}explain it all to her.{02}{00}
#1B1D {11}{01}, you saw Lord{03}Hammet heading north,{03}didn't you?{1E}{00}
#1B1E That must have been when{03}Lord Hammet went{03}toward Lunpa.{02}{00}
#1B1F No, I mean the day Lord{03}Hammet went toward{03}Lunpa...{02}{00}
#1B20 Lady Layana will surely{03}be glad to hear{03}your tale.{01}Please, come with me,{03}and tell her the{03}full story.{02}{00}
#1B21 When I heard that you{03}were back, {11}{03}, I had{03}dared to hope...{01}that Lord Hammet had{03}returned with you.{02}{00}
#1B22 We thought Lord Hammet{03}had been released{03}from Lunpa, too.{02}{00}
#1B23 We sent the ransom money{03}they demanded, so he{03}should return soon,{05} right?{02}{00}
#1B24 What's been happening in{03}Lunpa these days?{02}{00}
#1B25 The leadership in Lunpa{03}passed from its founder,{03}Lunpa, the noble thief,{01}to his son Donpa,{03}and then to Lunpa's{03}grandson...{02}{00}
#1B26 Dodonpa is a very{03}evil man.{01}His father, Donpa,{03}is heartbroken at the{03}state of Lunpa now.{02}{00}
#1B27 When did you send{03}the ransom money?{02}{00}
#1B28 Let's see...{05} First, the{03}volcano erupted...{02}{00}
#1B29 And the ransom note{03}came right after{03}the eruption.{02}{00}
#1B2A We rushed the money{03}to them right away.{03}I remember it well.{02}{00}
#1B2B It's been quite a while{03}since the eruption...{02}{00}
#1B2C Is it possible they have{03}no intention of letting{03}Lord Hammet go?{1E}{00}
#1B2D You think so, too,{03}{11}{01}?{02}{00}
#1B2E I don't want to believe{03}it either,{05} but something{03}seems wrong about this.{02}{00}
#1B2F Are you saying Dodonpa{03}won't release Hammet!?{02}{00}
#1B30 I agree with {11}{03}.{01}If they were going to{03}release him, they'd{03}have done it by now.{02}{00}
#1B31 I am sorry, Lady{03}Layana, but I think{03}{11}{03} might be right.{02}{00}
#1B32 What should we do?{05}{03}How can we rescue{03}Hammet?{02}{00}
#1B33 What... {05}What if something{03}has happened to him!?{02}{00}
#1B34 Let us handle this!{02}{00}
#1B35 My lady, this is exactly{03}what the soldiers of{03}Kalay are here for!{02}{00}
#1B36 Yes, Lady Layana!{05}{03}Please let us handle this!{02}{00}
#1B37 Command us to attack,{03}and we shall!{02}{00}
#1B38 I cannot do that...{05}{03}Not without thinking{03}it over carefully...{02}{00}
#1B39 How can we guarantee{03}Hammet's safety if we{03}send soldiers to attack?{02}{00}
#1B3A I cannot do it.{05} I{03}cannot put Hammet's{03}life at risk...{02}{00}
#1B3B Can't we do something{03}to help?{1E}{00}
#1B3C Oh!{05} Well, it's about{03}time you started{03}agreeing with me, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#1B3D What!? Look, we both{03}know Hammet's life is{03}in danger!{02}{00}
#1B3E What are you two{03}talking about?{02}{00}
#1B3F {11}{02} thinks that{03}we can help.{02}{00}
#1B40 It is too dangerous...{05}{03}If you fail, your lives{03}would be in danger, too.{02}{00}
#1B41 Besides, don't you have{03}your own quests to{03}pursue?{1E}{00}
#1B42 I thought so... I knew{03}there had to be a reason{03}{11}{03} had stayed with you,{01}instead of returning{03}home directly from{03}Vault.{02}{00}
#1B43 I do not believe that...{03}{11}{03} would not have stayed{03}with you for so long{01}if you did not have an{03}important task ahead.{02}{00}
#1B44 Then what will happen{03}to Lord Hammet?{02}{00}
#1B45 Hammet is a good hostage{03}for them...{05}{03}They will not kill him.{02}{00}
#1B46 We shall wait for another{03}message from Lunpa.{02}{00}
#1B47 Lady Layana,{05} I cannot{03}leave like this...{02}{00}
#1B48 It will be fine, {11}{03}.{05}{03}Hammet would not want to{03}distract you from{18}{02}{00}
#1B49 I apologize. I have said{03}more than I should...{02}{00}
#1B4A It sounds like Hammet{03}knows about our mission{03}...doesn't it?{02}{00}
#1B4B I suppose I can keep{03}it a secret no longer...{02}{00}
#1B4C Very well,{05} I shall tell{03}you.{05}.{05}.{01}He swore an oath{03}to a Jupiter Adept.{02}{00}
#1B4D A Jupiter Adept!?{02}{00}
#1B4E Have you heard of a{03}village called Vale?{1E}{00}
#1B4F You {09}{02}are{07} from Vale?{03}Really? Then the prophecy{03}was true.{02}{00}
#1B50 Give me a break! You{03}don't know Vale!? It's{03}our hometown!{02}{00}
#1B51 You are from Vale...?{03}Really? Then the prophecy{03}was true.{02}{00}
#1B52 What prophecy?{02}{00}
#1B53 Three years after the{03}terrible storm that struck{03}only Mt. Aleph...{02}{00}
#1B54 {11}{03} must depart on a{03}journey with warriors{03}from Vale...{01}So it was foretold.{02}{00}
#1B55 I've heard nothing of{03}any such prophecy.{02}{00}
#1B56 It happened several{03}years before Hammet{03}founded Kalay...{01}He was off traveling.{02}{00}
#1B57 Hammet felt he had{03}reached an impasse as{03}a merchant then.{02}{00}
#1B58 He risked his life on a{03}journey to find a new{03}source of business...{02}{00}
#1B59 He was in mortal danger{03}at the southwestern{03}edge of the world,{01}when some Adepts{03}appeared and saved{03}his life.{02}{00}
#1B5A He had lost consciousness.{03}When he awoke, he found{03}himself in their village.{02}{00}
#1B5B Just a moment... Am I{03}from that village?{02}{00}
#1B5C Yes.{05} The Adept gave him{03}the Shaman's Rod{05} and you...{03}along with some doubloons.{02}{00}
#1B5D Doubloons...{05}{05} Were they{03}{05}golden doubloons?{02}{00}
#1B5E Yes...{05} Let's see...{03}You are...called...{02}{00}
#1B5F I am {11}{04}, Lady Layana.{02}{00}
#1B60 It was a lot of gold, {11}{04},{05}{03}but he also received{03}some business advice.{02}{00}
#1B61 Business advice? Hammet?{03}The greatest merchant{03}ever known?{02}{00}
#1B62 Yes, {11}{02}{05}. Hammet{03}has the Adepts to thank{03}for his success.{02}{00}
#1B63 Wow... I've never heard{03}anything like that...{02}{00}
#1B64 He was advised to buy{03}silk in Xian and sell{03}it in Tolbi.{02}{00}
#1B65 To see anything sell{03}so well, it's like a{03}dream come true.{02}{00}
#1B66 There's no denying that{03}was when Hammet picked{03}up his knack for business.{02}{00}
#1B67 Did he have to promise{03}them anything in return?{02}{00}
#1B68 Ah, yes, {11}{03}...{05} It is{03}something you will{03}need on your journey.{02}{00}
#1B69 Something we need on{03}our journey...{02}{00}
#1B6A The Adept asked Hammet{03}to use the Shaman's Rod{03}to obtain it.{02}{00}
#1B6B He looked for this{03}object wherever he{03}went...{01}But he could never{03}find it.{02}{00}
#1B6C Then, three years ago, a{03}storm struck, one that hit{03}only Mt. Aleph...{02}{00}
#1B6D Hammet was worried{05}{05} that{03}time{05} was running out...{02}{00}
#1B6E But he had managed{03}to unearth a clue{03}just in time.{02}{00}
#1B6F That, {11}{03}, is why he took{03}you with the caravan on{03}his last journey north.{02}{00}
#1B70 I had no idea...{05} So that{03}must be why he left the{03}rod in my care.{05}{05} But then{18}{02}{00}
#1B71 No, {11}{03}...{05} You mustn't{03}blame yourself...{02}{00}
#1B72 It was my carelessness{03}that caused the rod to{03}be stolen. And ultimately,{01}that's why Lord Hammet{03}is being held in{03}Lunpa...{02}{00}
#1B73 You must continue your{03}journey and complete your{03}quest.{01}You can't blame yourself.{02}{00}
#1B74 But what will happen{03}to Hammet?{02}{00}
#1B75 I will handle this.{02}{00}
#1B76 And don't forget the{03}soldiers of Kalay!{02}{00}
#1B77 Continue on your journey,{03}and do not worry about{03}Hammet!{02}{00}
#1B78 I am sorry I cannot tell{03}you more about the{03}Shaman's Rod...{02}{00}
#1B79 No,{05} don't apologize...{02}{00}
#1B7A The Shaman's Rod'll help us{03}find that thing we need{03}for our quest, right?{02}{00}
#1B7B Will you look for it?{1E}{00}
#1B7C If {11}{01} says we will,{03}then there's nothing{03}to worry about!{02}{00}
#1B7D What's wrong with you,{03}{11}{01}? Did you forget{03}why we're here?{02}{00}
#1B7E If we need it for our{03}quest, we'll have to{03}find it sooner or later.{02}{00}
#1B7F Very well...{05} Take care{03}of yourselves.{02}{00}
#1B80 Return to your posts,{03}everyone!{02}{00}
#1B81 Dodonpa is a very shrewd{03}man. He may have sent{03}spies into Kalay.{01}We can't risk sending{03}our soldiers yet.{02}{00}
#1B82 The townsfolk don't{03}know about Lord Hammet{03}yet, do they?{02}{00}
#1B83 Lord Hammet will be{03}released soon. Right?{1E}{00}
#1B84 I hope so. Otherwise,{03}Layana will be{03}overwhelmed by sorrow.{02}{00}
#1B85 It wouldn't hurt you to{03}lie a little, you know!{02}{00}
#1B86 Layana is putting up a{03}strong front whenever{03}people are around.{01}It's so hard to{03}see her like this.{02}{00}
#1B87 Merchants are supposed{03}to be protected under{03}the laws of Angara.{01}Dodonpa must truly be{03}evil to break such a law!{02}{00}
#1B88 Has the legacy of Lord{03}Hammet's silk trading{03}come to an end?{1E}{00}
#1B89 How can you say that!{03}Lady Layana would be{03}devastated!{02}{00}
#1B8A You're right. I never{03}should have said that.{03}I feel terrible now.{02}{00}
#1B8B Is this the right{03}decision, Hammet?{03}Am I making a mistake?{02}{00}
#1B8C I'm sure the villagers{03}would panic if they knew{03}Hammet was a hostage...{01}We must be sure we do{03}not show it...{02}{00}
#1B8D Everyone's worried about{03}Lord Hammet, but no one{03}can talk about it openly.{01}If he isn't freed, it will{03}mean the end of Kalay...{02}{00}
#1B8E Lady Layana was crying{03}again last night.{01}I wish there were{03}something I could do.{02}{00}
#1B8F And to think...{03}I almost went on that{03}caravan with Hammet!{02}{00}
#1B90 Lord Hammet is a legend{03}among merchants. Kalay{03}can't survive without him.{02}{00}
#1B91 {11}{01}{05}, you sneaked into{03}Lunpa? That's far too{03}dangerous!{02}{00}
#1B92 But{05} I am happy to{03}learn that Hammet{03}is not hurt.{02}{00}
#1B93 Thank you, {11}{01}...{05}{03}But please, do not go{03}to Lunpa again.{02}{00}
#1B94 Please, fulfill your quest.{02}{00}
#1B95 Dodonpa plans to use{03}Hammet to get every last{03}penny he can from Kalay.{01}We shall have to{03}appease him until{03}we can rescue Hammet.{02}{00}
#1B96 I don't care about the{03}money, as long as Hammet{03}comes home safely...{02}{00}
#1B97 The soldiers of Kalay{03}will handle this{03}matter ourselves.{01}Please, go on with your{03}journey, as Lady Layana{03}requested.{02}{00}
#1B98 We'll take care of{03}this kidnapping incident{03}just fine.{01}You should continue on{03}your quest.{02}{00}
#1B99 I'm worried about Lord{03}Hammet, but Lady Layana{03}insists we do nothing.{01}I can only hope for{03}Lord Hammet's safety...{02}{00}
#1B9A The warriors of Kalay{03}will save Lord Hammet,{03}no matter the toll.{02}{00}
#1B9B The people in the inn{03}were tourists going to{03}see the Colosso.{01}All that fuss just to{03}see a carnival in Tolbi!{03}I don't get it.{02}{00}
#1B9C What's with you?{03}You wanna enter Lunpa?{1E}{00}
#1B9D Well, you can't!{03}Go back to where{03}you came from!{02}{00}
#1B9E You came all this way{03}for nothing? That{03}doesn't make any sense...{01}Lunpa's no place for{03}people like you. Go back{03}where you came from!{02}{00}
#1B9F You're not from Kalay,{05}{03}are you?{1E}{00}
#1BA0 That last group said the{03}same thing, but we{03}didn't trust them, either.{01}Leave now if you don't{03}want to get hurt.{02}{00}
#1BA1 You're not here to{03}save Hammet,{05} are you?{1E}{00}
#1BA2 We'll return Hammet to{03}Kalay very soon. Just{03}wait a little longer...{01}That's what Dodonpa{03}told us to say.{02}{00}
#1BA3 Oh, please! No one would{03}come to Lunpa unless{03}it was to save Hammet!{01}You don't want to make{03}me angry. You wouldn't{03}like me when I'm angry!{02}{00}
#1BA4 I wonder if these guys{03}will try to enter from the{03}cave west of town?{01}Well, the gate there is{03}too heavy for them to{03}lift, anyway. No worries!{02}{00}
#1BA5 Even if they enter{03}through the cave, they{03}can't get into town.{01}The gate in the cave{03}can only be opened{03}from the inside.{02}{00}
#1BA6 Have you been in Lunpa{03}long?{1E}{00}
#1BA7 Hmm... Your face doesn't{03}ring a bell. I guess you{03}don't really stand out.{02}{00}
#1BA8 Oh, so you're a new{03}member of Dodonpa's{03}gang?{02}{00}
#1BA9 We've had no freedom{03}ever since the caravan{03}came to the village.{01}We can't leave the{03}village, and no one is{03}allowed in. I hate it...{02}{00}
#1BAA Is it true that Dodonpa{03}kidnapped Hammet and{03}extorted ransom for him?{1E}{00}
#1BAB Then I guess Dodonpa's{03}men were telling the{03}truth.{02}{00}
#1BAC I didn't think so. Not{03}even Dodonpa would do{03}such a terrible thing.{02}{00}
#1BAD Donpa is too old to lead,{03}so his men do whatever{03}Dodonpa says.{02}{00}
#1BAE The righteous thief, Lunpa,{03}and his son, Donpa{18}{03}They were great men.{02}{00}
#1BAF Donpa has no idea what{03}Dodonpa is doing.{01}This village would change{03}if Donpa heard about{03}Dodonpa's evil deeds...{02}{00}
#1BB0 You want to see Donpa?{1E}{00}
#1BB1 Donpa is in the fortress.{03}You'll have to go there{03}if you want to see him.{01}But security at the{03}fortress is very tight.{02}{00}
#1BB2 I didn't think so...{03}It's impossible to{03}see Donpa now.{02}{00}
#1BB3 The chef from the inn{03}has been delivering meals{03}to the fortress lately.{01}He says security is very{03}tight{18}even inside the{03}fortress.{02}{00}
#1BB4 Don't come any closer.{02}{00}
#1BB5 How can Dodonpa be so{03}devious?{01}I can't believe he{03}is the son of Donpa.{02}{00}
#1BB6 Not even a mouse could{03}enter this fortress{03}while I'm on the watch!{02}{00}
#1BB7 I doubt anyone could{03}enter Lunpa now with all{03}this tight security.{02}{00}
#1BB8 It sure was strange{03}of Hammet to come here{03}just to get caught.{02}{00}
#1BB9 Once they get the ransom,{03}they'll set the hostages{03}free, no matter what.{01}But the merchant caravan{03}hasn't left yet.{03}What's going on?{02}{00}
#1BBA Lunpa died when Donpa{03}was still young. It{03}made Donpa a lonely man...{01}They say that's why he{03}spoiled Dodonpa so much...{03}What a mistake that was.{02}{00}
#1BBB Dodonpa can do his evil{03}deeds, but how can he{03}live like this?{01}If he makes any money,{03}he should pass it around{03}to us poor villagers.{02}{00}
#1BBC Dodonpa keeps Donpa{03}hidden away in the{03}fortress so that he won't{01}find out about all the{03}evil things Dodonpa has{03}been up to.{02}{00}
#1BBD The fortress is guarded{03}all day long.{01}No one outside the{03}fortress can get in to{03}see Donpa.{02}{00}
#1BBE The chef said the{03}fortress is so scary, he{03}never wants to go back.{02}{00}
#1BBF Dodonpa is a genius!{03}Not releasing Hammet{03}is so smart...{01}It's a great way to use{03}Hammet to keep extorting{03}money from Kalay.{02}{00}
#1BC0 You'd have to be a{03}shadow to sneak past me.{02}{00}
#1BC1 My late grandfather{03}traveled the continent{03}with Lunpa.{01}He would be very sad{03}to see the things{03}Dodonpa is doing now.{02}{00}
#1BC2 We may live in Lunpa, but{03}we'll never work for{03}Dodonpa.{02}{00}
#1BC3 Lunpa used to be a good{03}place, but not anymore.{02}{00}
#1BC4 They keep pushing us{03}to work for Dodonpa!{03}I can't stand it!{02}{00}
#1BC5 The fortress was built{03}during Donpa's rule.{01}He built his fortress{03}so well, not even an ant{03}could sneak in.{02}{00}
#1BC6 The inn's chef is the{03}only one in town who can{03}enter the fortress.{02}{00}
#1BC7 The fortress was built so{03}its guards could see{03}every corner.{02}{00}
#1BC8 After the caravan{03}of merchants was{03}captured...{01}That was when they{03}ordered the chef inside{03}the fortress.{02}{00}
#1BC9 Lunpa passed away long{03}ago, when the world was{03}hit by a huge flood.{01}Lunpa had gone south{05}...{03}and he was never seen{03}again after the flood.{02}{00}
#1BCA Lunpa was caught in the{03}great flood while traveling{03}with someone named Babi.{02}{00}
#1BCB They say the flood claimed{03}many lives, all across{03}the continent.{02}{00}
#1BCC What kind of name{03}is Babi, anyway?{02}{00}
#1BCD The village is sealed,{03}so we can't buy or sell{03}anything.{01}Dodonpa doesn't care{03}about my business.{02}{00}
#1BCE I'll sell you as much{03}armor as you like, once{03}the village is reopened.{02}{00}
#1BCF They bought a lot of{03}stock, which is why{03}they're holding up,{01}but I still feel bad{03}for them and all{03}the lost business.{02}{00}
#1BD0 Do you want to sleep at{03}my place?{1E}{00}
#1BD1 You must be kidding.{03}Go rest in your{03}own home!{02}{00}
#1BD2 Of course not! With no{03}travelers in town, no one{03}wants to stay here.{02}{00}
#1BD3 Dodonpa made a pretty{03}penny for himself by{03}capturing Hammet,{01}but he doesn't care{03}about what happens to{03}us villagers at all.{02}{00}
#1BD4 It doesn't matter how{03}much we clean or wait{03}for customers.{01}No one will come.{02}{00}
#1BD5 Do you want to hear{03}about how I delivered{03}meals to the fortress?{1E}{00}
#1BD6 I was blindfolded and{03}guided along a cool path.{03}I walked for a while.{01}I heard my footsteps{03}echoing, so it must have{03}been an underground path.{02}{00}
#1BD7 I was so relieved when{03}I got back to the{03}village.{01}The guy I delivered{03}food to? They called{03}him Hammet.{02}{00}
#1BD8 I just have to hang in{03}there. I'm not closing my{03}inn 'til the village is free.{02}{00}
#1BD9 Dodonpa doesn't care{03}about anyone but himself.{03}That's why he does this...{02}{00}
#1BDA At this rate,{03}I'll be fired before{03}I know it...{02}{00}
#1BDB I feel bad for that poor{03}man they've got locked{03}up in the dungeon...{02}{00}
#1BDC I think that thief Dodonpa{03}is a terrible man.{01}But it's not fair to blame{03}the Lunpans for it.{03}They need our care, too.{02}{00}
#1BDD We can't leave Lunpa{18}{03}not when Dodonpa's men{03}are watching like that.{02}{00}
#1BDE I'll have to close this{03}shop soon if things{03}don't change...{02}{00}
#1BDF I should have bought{03}more stock while I{03}had the chance...{02}{00}
#1BE0 I bought a lot of{03}stock, but I'm already{03}running out...{02}{00}
#1BE1 This is Lunpa. You{03}cannot enter without{03}Dodonpa's authorization.{02}{00}
#1BE2 If outsiders cause any{03}trouble in the village,{01}Dodonpa will hold{03}us responsible.{02}{00}
#1BE3 Hey,{05} if it isn't{03}{11}{01}! You came back{03}home, huh?{02}{00}
#1BE4 This is Vale!{05}{03}...Wait, you already know{03}that, right, {11}{01}?{02}{00}
#1BE5 Oh, {11}{01}!{03}You came back sooner{03}than I thought!{02}{00}
#1BE6 It looks like you made{03}some friends in your{03}travels, {11}{01}.{01}I'm glad to see that.{02}{00}
#1BE7 The river in town{03}grew so hot after{03}Mt. Aleph erupted.{01}Everyone got excited,{03}thinking there were hot{03}springs on the mountain,{01}but then the river{03}cooled down again.{02}{00}
#1BE8 Did you see anything{03}interesting on your trip,{03}{11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#1BE9 You didn't, hmm? I can{03}see in your eyes that{03}you're not being honest.{02}{00}
#1BEA Oh, really? That must{03}have been exciting!{01}Maybe I can join you{03}on your next journey?{1E}{00}
#1BEB Ha ha, really?{01}I was just kidding.{03}You don't need to be{03}so polite.{02}{00}
#1BEC Yeah... I knew you{03}would say no...{02}{00}
#1BED Oh, my! {11}{01}!{03}How have you been!{02}{00}
#1BEE Welcome back, {11}{01}!{03}It's good to have you{03}home!{02}{00}
#1BEF I see you made many{03}friends on your journey.{01}I wish I could be{03}like you, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#1BF0 The eruption created{03}a terrible mess on the{03}other side of Mt. Aleph.{02}{00}
#1BF1 The eruption caused a{03}crack to open on Mt.{03}Aleph's northwest side.{02}{00}
#1BF2 You surprised us, {11}{01}!{03}You're back sooner{03}than anyone expected!{02}{00}
#1BF3 {11}{01} has grown so{03}much so quickly. He{03}looks splendid...{02}{00}
#1BF4 {11}{01}'s new friends{03}look interesting.{01}I wonder if they're{03}Adepts, like us?{02}{00}
#1BF5 Eruptions must have{03}great power if they{03}can heat a river!{02}{00}
#1BF6 I sense that Mt. Aleph is{03}not the only place to{03}see strange events.{01}Crossing the continent{03}must indeed be{03}difficult.{02}{00}
#1BF7 Oh, my! When did you{03}return to Vale, {11}{01}?{02}{00}
#1BF8 I wonder if we can play{03}with {11}{01} and his pals{03}again, like we used to.{02}{00}
#1BF9 I want to go on a{03}journey and make new{03}friends, too!{02}{00}
#1BFA A river of lava burnt{03}everything on the other{03}side of Mt. Aleph.{02}{00}
#1BFB The crack on Mt. Aleph's{03}northwest side is{03}widening.{01}At this rate, the whole{03}continent will split in half!{02}{00}
#1BFC The path to Sol Sanctum{03}is still closed.{01}You'll have to wait{03}until the volcanic{03}activity subsides.{02}{00}
#1BFD {11}{01}, are your new{03}friends Adepts by{03}any chance?{1E}{00}
#1BFE So, there are others{03}besides Valeans who have{03}been granted Psynergy?{02}{00}
#1BFF ......{00}
#1C00 ......{00}
#1C01 Your friend seems{03}angered by your{03}words, {11}{01}...{01}That means...{03}they {09}{02}must{07} be Adepts!{02}{00}
#1C02 Why is it that different{03}Adepts have different{03}powers?{01}Is it because they{03}meditate more, like{03}the Great Healer?{02}{00}
#1C03 It'll be difficult to reach{03}Sol Sanctum until Mt.{03}Aleph returns to normal.{02}{00}
#1C04 I see a beautiful girl{03}has joined {11}{01}{03}on his journey.{01}I wonder what {11}{06}{03}will think when she{03}sees this.{02}{00}
#1C05 It's not fair! I want to{03}have strong Psynergy, but{03}I hate working for it.{02}{00}
#1C06 Oh, {05}it's you, {11}{01}.{03}You came back?{1E}{00}
#1C07 Vale won't be very{03}quiet anymore...{01}But I'm glad to see you.{03}Your mother, Dora, will{03}be, too.{02}{00}
#1C08 Oh, you're not back for{03}good? That's too bad.{02}{00}
#1C09 I heard you were back.{03}I guess the rumor was{03}true.{01}Are you going to tell{03}us all the great tales{03}from your journey?{02}{00}
#1C0A {11}{01}! When did you{03}come back? After the{03}way you left,{01}I thought I might{03}never see you again.{01}I'm very happy to{03}see you.{02}{00}
#1C0B Ow!{05} It's gonna be years{03}before I'm a grown-up!{03}But {11}{01}'s back already!{01}Oh...{03}You are just visiting...{03}You got me surprised.{02}{00}
#1C0C Welcome home, {11}{01}!{03}Oh...{05} ...{03}What happened?{01}Why are you walking{03}around with some girl{03}who's not {11}{06}?{02}{00}
#1C0D We've seen many monsters{03}lately, and it's become{03}quite dangerous outside{01}the village.{03}That's why weapons{03}are selling well.{01}If only the blacksmiths{03}could make better{03}weapons...{02}{00}
#1C0E I wish I could learn the{03}secret to making{03}good weapons...{02}{00}
#1C0F I gave him a farewell{03}gift thinking I'd{03}never see him again...{01}But I didn't have to...{01}And wasn't he supposed{03}to bring {11}{06} back{03}with him...?{02}{00}
#1C10 I promised I'd become{03}a great blacksmith before{03}{11}{01} comes back again.{01}It's a man's promise,{03}and I have to keep it.{02}{00}
#1C11 That shy girl with{03}{11}{01}{05} sure looks{03}like a nice girl.{02}{00}
#1C12 What happened to {11}{06}?{03}Haven't you found{03}her yet?{02}{00}
#1C13 Well if it isn't {11}{01}!{01}You've grown so much,{03}I almost didn't{03}recognize you!{02}{00}
#1C14 Oh, it's you, {11}{01}.{03}You came back, huh?{02}{00}
#1C15 You've come all the way{03}home just to stay{03}here? Are you sure?{1E}{00}
#1C16 Oh, I see... You don't want{03}to get used to staying{03}at home...{01}In that case, you're{03}more than welcome...{02}{00}
#1C17 That's better! You've come{03}all the way back. Now,{03}go on home.{02}{00}
#1C18 You traveled around the{03}eastern edge of the{03}continent?{01}You must be{03}exhausted!{02}{00}
#1C19 Aren't you glad to see{03}the village hasn't{03}changed?{02}{00}
#1C1A Does {11}{01} know that{03}Dora was struck with{03}an illness?{02}{00}
#1C1B I wonder if {11}{01}{03}came here because Dora{03}wouldn't let him stay...{01}Other than the mayor,{03}no one else knows{03}about Dora's illness...{02}{00}
#1C1C I wonder if {11}{01} will{03}continue his journey.{03}It must be quite difficult.{02}{00}
#1C1D Vale will never change,{03}so you can come{03}home whenever you like.{02}{00}
#1C1E Hey...{02}{00}
#1C1F What?{02}{00}
#1C20 Shouldn't we look{03}for {11}{02}?{02}{00}
#1C21 Why?{02}{00}
#1C22 {11}{01} still doesn't know{03}about Dora...{05}right?{03}Someone should tell him.{02}{00}
#1C23 You miss {11}{02}, don't you?{03}You're looking for an{03}excuse to find him.{02}{00}
#1C24 What? No! I just...{02}{00}
#1C25 {09}{04}Guh...{05}{05} Gah...{05} Ugh...{02}{00}
#1C26 Grandma! What's the{03}matter? Are you{03}choking?{02}{00}
#1C27 It's... It's {11}{02}!{02}{00}
#1C28 She must miss{03}{11}{02}, too...{02}{00}
#1C29 No, it's really {11}{02}!{03}Look, look!{02}{00}
#1C2A {11}{02}!{1E}{00}
#1C2B Oh, {11}{02}...!{1E}{00}
#1C2C Mom, Dad...{05} I'm home...{02}{00}
#1C2D What,{05} {11}{02}?{02}{00}
#1C2E Oh, {11}{02}...!{02}{00}
#1C2F Grandpa,{03}I'm home...{02}{00}
#1C30 Yes, yes...{05} Did you{03}complete your mission{03}for the Wise One?{1E}{00}
#1C31 Oh, you mean it's going{03}well? You probably have{03}to continue on soon, then.{02}{00}
#1C32 Not yet? Well, I'm glad{03}you're home, even if it's{03}just for a little while...{02}{00}
#1C33 You're leaving again{03}soon...aren't you?{02}{00}
#1C34 I'm just glad to see{03}you're doing well!{02}{00}
#1C35 That's right.{02}{00}
#1C36 Let me introduce you{03}to my new friends.{02}{00}
#1C37 Umm...{05} I am {11}{03}.{03}Pleased to meet you.{02}{00}
#1C38 I am {11}{04}, from Imil.{03}Nice to meet you.{02}{00}
#1C39 Nice to meet you.{03}Please look after{03}young {11}{02} for us.{02}{00}
#1C3A Well{05}, enough chit-chat.{03}Relax and enjoy your{03}stay here...{02}{00}
#1C3B {11}{04} is such a{03}nice girl.{01}I wonder who {11}{02}{03}likes more, {11}{04} or{03}{11}{06}...{02}{00}
#1C3C That {11}{03} seems to be{03}a smart boy...{01}I wish you could be more{03}like {11}{03}, {11}{02}.{02}{00}
#1C3D Did you hear us talking{03}about Dora just now?{1E}{00}
#1C3E Dora told us not to{03}worry...that it's just{03}a fever.{01}Don't worry too much,{03}{11}{01}.{02}{00}
#1C3F You didn't hear? But you{03}look concerned.{01}We'll be looking after{03}your mother, so don't{03}worry.{02}{00}
#1C40 I hope you didn't get{03}sick during your{03}travels...{01}{11}{02} always eats{03}too much... He always{03}makes his mother worry.{02}{00}
#1C41 It must be nice to be{03}young and gallivant{03}about with lovely girls!{02}{00}
#1C42 His new friends are all{03}so polite. I'm very happy{03}to see that.{02}{00}
#1C43 It wasn't too smart to{03}talk about Dora without{03}checking for {11}{01}.{01}I wish we could tell{03}him the truth.{02}{00}
#1C44 {11}{02} seems to have{03}grown up a bit on{03}this difficult journey.{02}{00}
#1C45 Ah!{02}{00}
#1C46 It's been a while...{02}{00}
#1C47 You're back?{02}{00}
#1C48 Have you gone home{03}to see Dad yet?{1E}{00}
#1C49 Really?{05} He must have{03}been happy to see you.{01}He has been so{03}worried about you.{02}{00}
#1C4A You have to see him...{05}{03}He's been worried{03}about you.{02}{00}
#1C4B ...{05}So have I.{02}{00}
#1C4C Sis...{02}{00}
#1C4D Don't get me wrong.{05} I...{03}I was just worried you{03}might get into trouble,{01}because, you know,{03}you're not that bright...{02}{00}
#1C4E Yeah, all right...{03}Thanks, Sis.{02}{00}
#1C4F So, {05}{05}are you home{03}for good? Or...{02}{00}
#1C50 Not just yet...{02}{00}
#1C51 You're leaving...{05}{03}again?{02}{00}
#1C52 Don't push yourself too{03}hard...{05}when you{03}leave again.{02}{00}
#1C53 Hey, how have you been?{02}{00}
#1C54 Oh,{05} {11}{02}!{03}And {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#1C55 What happened!?{03}You're back already!?{02}{00}
#1C56 Already? What kind of{03}way is that to{03}greet us?{02}{00}
#1C57 But{18}But they said{03}you might never come{03}back!{02}{00}
#1C58 And it still seems like{03}you're not back for good,{03}like you're just visiting.{02}{00}
#1C59 Really?{05} Is that{03}what it seems like?{02}{00}
#1C5A Yeah... You and your{03}friends... You all look like{03}you are about to leave.{02}{00}
#1C5B You're smarter than{03}you look.{02}{00}
#1C5C I have to shape up{03}while you're gone, right?{03}If not...{02}{00}
#1C5D Hey, the family'll be fine,{03}as long as you're here!{03}Am I right, or what?{1E}{00}
#1C5E Take care of our family{03}while I'm gone.{03}All right?{02}{00}
#1C5F Hey! You're not{03}helping here!{02}{00}
#1C60 WHAT{05}EVER{05} YOU{05} DO{05},{03}you must protect the{03}family while I'm gone.{01}All right? I'm counting{03}on you!{02}{00}
#1C61 Don't push yourself{03}too hard,{05}{05} OK?{02}{00}
#1C62 I can tell just by looking{03}at you that you've been{03}through a lot.{01}You look so much{03}more mature now.{02}{00}
#1C63 I will do my best to{03}show everyone that I{03}am strong enough{01}to protect our family{03}and Vale.{02}{00}
#1C64 You guys are working so{03}hard, but I'm worried.{03}Are you really all right?{02}{00}
#1C65 I could go with you if I{03}were a little older...{03}It's not fair...{02}{00}
#1C66 {09}{04}Cough, cough{05}{05}! {07}Who is it?{05}{03}Is it the innkeeper?{05}{05}{03}Is it time to eat?{02}{00}
#1C67 No? {09}{04}Cough...{07}{05}{05}{03}Then who{18}{02}{00}
#1C68 {11}{01}...{02}{00}
#1C69 Are you finally home?{03}Have you completed{03}your mission!?{02}{00}
#1C6A You haven't, have you?{02}{00}
#1C6B Have you forgotten your{03}promise, {11}{01}?{02}{00}
#1C6C You promised you wouldn't{03}come back until your{03}quest was complete, right?{1E}{00}
#1C6D You broke your promise{03}because you were worried{03}about me?{02}{00}
#1C6E You were more worried{03}about me than about{03}keeping your promise?{02}{00}
#1C6F Who told you I was ill?{03}The mayor? Or {09}{04}cough{07}{03}...was it the innkeeper?{1E}{00}
#1C70 So you came because{03}you were worried after{03}hearing about me.{02}{00}
#1C71 Are you telling me{03}you were surprised to{03}see me in bed?{02}{00}
#1C72 You can't get out of your{03}promises just because{03}you're worried about me.{01}{09}{04}Cough...{07}{02}{00}
#1C73 I... {09}{04}Cough...{07}{05}{03}I just caught a{03}cold. That's all.{02}{00}
#1C74 But I'm fine now. {05}{05}{03}{09}{04}Cough...{07}{05} Look!{02}{00}
#1C75 See?{05} I'm fine!{02}{00}
#1C76 Don't worry about me.{03}Go on. Do your best to{03}complete your quest.{05}{05} OK?{02}{00}
#1C77 Don't you worry about{03}me. Just do your best{03}to complete your quest.{01}{09}{04}Cough cough...{07}{02}{00}
#1C78 I'm sorry I seemed so{03}harsh, {11}{01}...{01}I'm so happy to see you.{03}I'll be waiting for you to{03}come home for good...{02}{00}
#1C79 {09}{04}Unn...{05} Ohh...{05}{05}{03}Kyle...{05} Don't go...{02}{00}
#1C7A I think Dora{03}is dreaming.{02}{00}
#1C7B Kyle, watch out!{05}{05}{03}The boulder!!!{05}{03}The boulder...{02}{00}
#1C7C Oh, so you still haven't{03}rescued {11}{06}...{02}{00}
#1C7D I get over colds quickly.{01}But it sure is taking{03}Dora a long time to{03}recover from hers.{02}{00}
#1C7E A cold is going around.{03}I should be careful.{02}{00}
#1C7F Will I ever see {11}{06}{03}and {11}{05} again{03}before I die?{02}{00}
#1C80 Dora says it's just a{03}cold, but she's been like{03}this ever since...{01}{11}{01} left...{03}It's taking her so{03}long to recover...{02}{00}
#1C81 I know that there are{03}always cold outbreaks{03}when winter comes...{01}But still...{02}{00}
#1C82 What was that "Alchemy"{03}that Kraden was always{03}researching?{01}I feel it was{03}something that was{03}better left alone...{02}{00}
#1C83 Earthquakes still strike{03}once in a while...{01}It gives me the{03}chills every time...{02}{00}
#1C84 Even if the eruption{03}had no relation to{03}Alchemy...{01}I still don't want{03}Kraden to come back{03}to the village.{02}{00}
#1C85 Every time the ground{03}shakes, I worry there{03}will be another eruption.{02}{00}
#1C86 The mountain is apparently{03}still casting Psynergy{03}Stones about.{01}People who have been{03}beyond the gate say{03}they've seen them{01}beside the roadside.{02}{00}
#1C87 If the Psynergy Stones{03}in the mountain{03}continue to be scattered...{01}Mt. Aleph won't have{03}any Psynergy Stones left{03}someday.{02}{00}
#1C88 The northwest face of Mt.{03}Aleph was all scorched by{03}a river of lava.{02}{00}
#1C89 They say the lava looked{03}like the bowels of the{03}earth had spilt forth.{02}{00}
#1C8A The Great Healers are{03}too afraid to go to Sol{03}Sanctum anymore.{01}They have nothing to fear.{03}Their Psynergy should{03}protect them.{02}{00}
#1C8B The healers are supposed{03}to guard Sol Sanctum.{03}How can they not go in?{02}{00}
#1C8C I can't stop wondering{03}what lies beyond{03}this fence.{02}{00}
#1C8D Oh, {05}it's {11}{01}, isn't it?{03}Is {05}{11}{06}{05} back yet?{01}Promise me, {11}{01}...{03}{05}Promise me you'll bring {11}{06}{03}with you next time.{02}{00}
#1C8E Promise me, {11}{01}...{03}{05}Promise me you'll bring{03}{11}{06} back home.{02}{00}
#1C8F You didn't bring{03}{11}{06} with you?{02}{00}
#1C90 I still remember when{03}{11}{05} and I used to{03}play here...*Sniff*{02}{00}
#1C91 {11}{05} must be{03}protecting {11}{06}...{03}I'm sure of it.{02}{00}
#1C92 I was trying to catch that{03}fish, and you killed it.{03}Why did you do that?{02}{00}
#1C93 So there were{03}monstrous fishes{03}in this river?{02}{00}
#1C94 Hey!{05} Where'd that{03}Psynergy Stone go?{03}It's gone!{02}{00}
#1C95 All that's left is a{03}big hole in my roof.{01}But the memory of the{03}eruption won't go away,{03}even once I've fixed it.{02}{00}
#1C96 You must have so many{03}memories of this{03}cottage, don't you?{1E}{00}
#1C97 I thought so. You{03}used to visit Kraden{03}a lot, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#1C98 I understand. You{03}don't have time to{03}dwell on old memories...{02}{00}
#1C99 Mt. Aleph's eruption was{03}so powerful, it caused{03}the continent to crack!{02}{00}
#1C9A Aghh!{05} I felt another one!{02}{00}
#1C9B They've been going on{03}for a while. I can't even{03}sleep at night!{02}{00}
#1C9C They say the danger is{03}gone, even though the{03}earthquakes continue...{02}{00}
#1C9D I wonder why we haven't{03}seen any travelers{03}since the eruption...{01}Do you know why,{03}{11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#1C9E Oh, the bridge to the{03}south was ruined?{03}That explains it.{02}{00}
#1C9F You don't know either?{03}It's not like we banned{03}visitors after the eruption.{02}{00}
#1CA0 I have a feeling my{03}adventures will begin{03}once I pass this fence.{02}{00}
#1CA1 There are definitely{03}monstrous fish in this{03}river.{02}{00}
#1CA2 No ordinary fish could{03}make a splash like{03}that!{01}That would take a{03}MONSTER FISH!{02}{00}
#1CA3 Aww.. I wish I could{03}show that fish to{03}everyone...{01}Then I could prove to{03}everyone that I was{03}right!{02}{00}
#1CA4 You mean it wasn't just{03}monstrous, but was{03}actually a monster?{01}{03}Wow! That's incredible.{02}{00}
#1CA5 The impact from the{03}eruption was too much for{03}the people of Vale.{02}{00}
#1CA6 I wonder why I feel so{03}lonely whenever I come{03}here...{01}I wasn't even that{03}close to Kraden...{02}{00}
#1CA7 The earthquakes aren't{03}caused by eruptions.{01}I think they're from{03}the continent splitting{03}into two.{02}{00}
#1CA8 Ahh... I can't stand{03}these earthquakes!{03}I wish they'd stop!!!{02}{00}
#1CA9 The smoke from Mt. Aleph{03}isn't thick at all.{03}It looks okay now.{02}{00}
#1CAA Having no travelers{03}is no fun at all...{02}{00}
#1CAB You! You're the warriors{03}who captured the thieves{03}a while back, aren't you?{01}You've returned to Vault!{02}{00}
#1CAC You've probably already{03}heard, but the bridge{03}to Kalay has been fixed.{02}{00}
#1CAD I wonder what happened{03}to Hammet when he{03}went to Lunpa...{02}{00}
#1CAE There have been rumors{03}of thieves from Lunpa{03}running wild,{01}but we haven't been{03}paying them much mind.{01}I wonder why those guys{03}have been so quiet{03}recently.{02}{00}
#1CAF Oh, it's you... I was just{03}talking about you with{03}our mayor.{01}You're all really strong,{03}so I say, let those thieves{03}attack!{01}They won't be able{03}to get past you!{02}{00}
#1CB0 If the volcano stays calm{03}and the southern bridge{03}stays fixed,{01}we won't have any{03}worries at all.{02}{00}
#1CB1 Hey, it's that{03}warrior guy!{02}{00}
#1CB2 Yeah, and {11}{03}, too.{02}{00}
#1CB3 I'm so glad you{03}came back to Vault!{02}{00}
#1CB4 I wish Vault's elders{03}were as brave as you!{02}{00}
#1CB5 Oh, so did you guys{03}check out the jail?{1E}{00}
#1CB6 How did those thugs{03}break out of jail?{01}The bars are{03}really strong.{02}{00}
#1CB7 The thieves broke out{03}of jail and got away.{01}After you guys went{03}to all the trouble of{03}capturing them...{02}{00}
#1CB8 The thieves escaped,{03}but I think it's all right.{01}It's all part of a{03}divine plan.{02}{00}
#1CB9 Bow wow wow wow!{02}{00}
#1CBA I can't believe they're{03}here! What great timing!{02}{00}
#1CBB When those guys from{03}Kalay came to fix the{03}bridge,{01}they looked like{03}they were worried about{03}something.{02}{00}
#1CBC Yeah, some warriors from{03}Kalay came to Vault{03}asking about Hammet.{01}Did Hammet get captured{03}after all?{02}{00}
#1CBD Once Dodonpa took over,{03}Lunpa's outlaws became no{03}better than thieves.{01}There's gotta be a{03}reason those guys are{03}being so quiet.{02}{00}
#1CBE Those stupid thieves{03}escaped, and we don't{03}know where they are.{01}They hated these kids{03}for capturing them.{03}I wonder if they'd...{02}{00}
#1CBF It would have been great{03}to have everything solved{03}before winter came.{02}{00}
#1CC0 Watching you guys makes{03}me feel brave.{01}I hope you'll tell{03}me all about your{03}travels sometime.{02}{00}
#1CC1 Grown-ups always get so{03}scared whenever anything{03}happens.{01}I get so tired{03}of that...{02}{00}
#1CC2 It's not like it's{03}easy to grab the{03}key to that jail.{01}They were able to get{03}the key out, so they know{03}the secret of the lock...{01}That must have{03}been great!{02}{00}
#1CC3 I keep wondering... Was{03}our statue stolen because{03}my conduct was{05}{05} wrong?{02}{00}
#1CC4 If you bring me some{03}bones, I'll tell you{03}a secret.{02}{00}
#1CC5 Owwwoooooh!{02}{00}
#1CC6 Bow wow wow!{02}{00}
#1CC7 How did you know I{03}wanted one of these?{02}{00}
#1CC8 {09}{04}Waah! {07}{05}{03}A cat ate my{03}precious stone!{01}That never should have{03}happened, but it's true.{02}{00}
#1CC9 I thought I saw the{03}cat get up on the table{03}and paw that gemstone...{01}and then our beloved{03}treasure was gone!{02}{00}
#1CCA If I'd known this was{03}going to happen, I would{03}have sold it.{02}{00}
#1CCB My husband says my cat{03}ate the treasure, but I{03}don't believe him.{02}{00}
#1CCC The prisoners said they{03}wanted to break out of{03}jail before Colosso began.{01}Colosso... Isn't that{03}the big festival in Tolbi?{02}{00}
#1CCD Dodonpa's henchmen never{03}attacked us, did they?{01}Maybe those thieves{03}weren't from Lunpa{03}after all.{02}{00}
#1CCE Why do you suppose those{03}thieves would be so{03}interested in Colosso?{02}{00}
#1CCF Daddy hasn't been paying{03}attention, since Dodonpa's{03}men never attacked us.{02}{00}
#1CD0 It's near time for Colosso{03}to start in Tolbi, isn't it?{01}I'd like to go once{03}more before I die.{02}{00}
#1CD1 The warriors I saw{03}fighting at Colosso were{03}so powerful...{01}I couldn't take my{03}eyes off them.{02}{00}
#1CD2 Whenever my wife used to{03}go to Tolbi for Colosso,{01}she would always check{03}out the gladiators...{01}That's why I won't{03}take her with me if{03}I go again.{02}{00}
#1CD3 Lately, my husband's been{03}going on and on about{03}Colosso.{01}I wonder if he might{03}take me this year...{02}{00}
#1CD4 Oh, {11}{01}!{03}You've come back{03}to Vault!{02}{00}
#1CD5 Ever since you left, all{03}sorts of crazy things{03}have been happening...{02}{00}
#1CD6 Those thieves you caught{03}have escaped from jail.{02}{00}
#1CD7 We were worried that{03}they might come after you.{03}Have you run into them?{1E}{00}
#1CD8 If you see any suspicious{03}shadows, it might be them,{03}so watch out.{02}{00}
#1CD9 Well, that's good...{03}But be careful. There's no{03}telling what they might do.{02}{00}
#1CDA Those guys really wanted{03}revenge on you, so take{03}good care of yourselves.{02}{00}
#1CDB The mayor's family urn{03}is on display now. You{03}ought to go see it.{02}{00}
#1CDC Those thieves!{03}You go to all that trouble{03}catching them,{01}and then we let them{03}get away.{02}{00}
#1CDD I hear that a big{03}festival is about to start{03}in some faraway town.{01}I'd sure like to see what{03}kind of festival it is{03}sometime.{02}{00}
#1CDE As long as we stay alert,{03}those thieves won't{03}give us any trouble.{02}{00}
#1CDF We'll be securing it in a{03}safe place soon, so I hope{03}they see it soon.{02}{00}
#1CE0 It's just embarrassing{03}that we let those{03}thieves get away.{02}{00}
#1CE1 I love festivals!{03}I'll bet Colosso is{03}just incredible.{02}{00}
#1CE2 There's a river of fire{03}on the other side{03}of Mt. Aleph.{01}Something big is happening.{02}{00}
#1CE3 Just imagine how terrible{03}it would be if that had{03}happened over here!{02}{00}
#1CE4 They say the volcano on{03}Mt. Aleph has torn our{03}continent in two!{01}The eruption of Mt. Aleph{03}was incredible, big enough{03}to split the continent.{02}{00}
#1CE5 It's a good thing that{03}giant crevasse opened{03}up, though.{01}Otherwise, the lava flow{03}would have spilled{03}directly into us!{02}{00}
#1CE6 We haven't been getting{03}many customers lately.{01}Maybe I'll close{03}early today.{02}{00}
#1CE7 Why keep the store{03}open if we don't have{03}any customers?{02}{00}
#1CE8 I may be wrong, but lately,{03}there seem to be a lot of{03}earthquakes on Mt. Aleph.{02}{00}
#1CE9 I polished the gold{03}statue you returned{03}to us.{01}It's so shiny, you won't{03}even recognize it!{02}{00}
#1CEA I hope the earthquakes{03}aren't a sign of something{03}worse coming...{02}{00}
#1CEB That dirty golden statue{03}cleaned up pretty well.{03}Sure makes me feel good.{02}{00}
#1CEC Mmmm. Nothing to do,{03}nothing to do. I hate this!{01}It's all because no one's{03}coming to the village, what{03}with the volcano and all.{02}{00}
#1CED We don't get a lot of{03}travelers in winter.{01}Spring seems like such{03}a long way off,{03}you know?{02}{00}
#1CEE I did some cooking, so{03}now I've got all these{03}useless bones.{01}...You want some?{1E}{00}
#1CEF Oh, you do? Really?{03}Help yourself, take as{03}many as you like.{02}{00}
#1CF0 You're right. You can't{03}just live on bones,{03}now can you?{02}{00}
#1CF1 There, you see? The roof{03}repairs are all finished.{02}{00}
#1CF2 Won't anyone come stay{03}the night here? It could{03}be a thief, for all I care.{02}{00}
#1CF3 After you've been in this{03}business for a while, you{03}start to understand...{01}After hard times, good{03}times will come again.{02}{00}
#1CF4 He really likes bones.{03}Hmm... I wonder if he's{03}got a calcium deficiency.{02}{00}
#1CF5 That's the last of{03}the roof repairs.{03}What should I do next?{02}{00}
#1CF6 I hit somebody, so they{03}put me in here. What I{03}did was stupid, wasn't it?{02}{00}
#1CF7 I need to learn to{03}control my temper.{02}{00}
#1CF8 Do you{05} want{03}to go to Tolbi?{1E}{00}
#1CF9 You can't go any further{03}along Silk Road.{01}If you're going to Tolbi,{03}you have to cross{03}the Karagol Sea.{02}{00}
#1CFA I see. {05}Well then, how{03}about taking a long{03}look around the ship?{02}{00}
#1CFB We can't take Silk{03}Road, so everyone's{03}in a pickle.{01}It's too expensive{03}to get a ticket{03}on a ship.{02}{00}
#1CFC You can't take Silk{03}Road much further{03}than this.{01}Everyone who goes to{03}check gives up and{03}comes back.{02}{00}
#1CFD Are you going to{03}take the ship?{1E}{00}
#1CFE When you reach Tolbi,{03}please pass a message{03}to my daughter.{01}Her mother says that{03}tickets are too expensive{03}and she can't go there.{02}{00}
#1CFF Is that so? {05}Well, then{03}I guess I'll ask{03}someone else then.{02}{00}
#1D00 With Silk Road{03}closed, everyone will{03}have to cross by ship.{01}The captain stands to{03}make a lot of money.{02}{00}
#1D01 I can't believe how{03}expensive tickets are.{01}We've come this far,{03}and we can't take{03}Silk Road.{01}Well, it's too late{03}for us to turn back.{02}{00}
#1D02 Well, isn't this great!{03}We can't take Silk Road,{03}and Colosso is starting!{01}My daughter left Tolbi{03}to meet us at the docks.{03}I'm really sad about this.{02}{00}
#1D03 We've spent a year{03}planning this trip,{03}and now this happens.{02}{00}
#1D04 Are you looking for{03}tickets for boarding?{1E}{00}
#1D05 Please buy a ticket if{03}you're planning to{03}travel by ship.{02}{00}
#1D06 Let's see...there are four{03}of you, so it will cost{03}{16} coins. Okay?{1E}{00}
#1D07 You're{05} not going to do it?{03}If you don't get onboard,{03}you can't get to Tolbi.{02}{00}
#1D08 Uh oh...{05} You don't have{03}enough money. I can't{03}sell you a ticket.{02}{00}
#1D09 Uh oh...{05} You've got too{03}much equipment{18}I can't{03}give you your ticket.{01}Please come back after{03}you've organized your{03}equipment.{02}{00}
#1D0A All right then, please{03}take your ticket.{02}{00}
#1D0B Hand in your ticket{03}at the ship's plank.{02}{00}
#1D0C Hmmm, that's strange.{05}{03}Isn't the replacement ship{03}here yet?{02}{00}
#1D0D Once we've crossed the{03}Karagol, we'll reach Tolbi.{03}Ohh, I'm excited.{02}{00}
#1D0E I feel sort of bad that{03}I have to charge so much{03}for these tickets.{02}{00}
#1D0F If you've already bought{03}your ticket, hurry up and{03}board the ship.{02}{00}
#1D10 The ship won't leave here{03}till the next ship arrives.{03}That's how it works.{01}I doubt that we'll set sail{03}before the other one{03}gets here.{02}{00}
#1D11 Let's get going! I'm{03}not getting any younger...{01}Or is my husband thinking{03}of giving up on{03}Colosso this year?{02}{00}
#1D12 Today there are supposed{03}to be lots of tourists{03}on the ship.{01}We're not going to check{03}the tickets until the tour{03}group gets here.{02}{00}
#1D13 The ship will be open{03}until the tourists arrive.{03}Feel free to look around.{02}{00}
#1D14 The captain's in a good{03}mood today because we{03}have so many passengers.{02}{00}
#1D15 The captain's in a good{03}mood. That's why he{03}opened the ship up.{01}Everything's going great.{02}{00}
#1D16 Tickets, please. Please{03}show your tickets.{02}{00}
#1D17 You can't board the ship{03}without a ticket.{01}Please go and purchase{03}a ticket.{02}{00}
#1D18 Thank you very much.{03}Please board the ship,{03}and we'll set sail soon.{02}{00}
#1D19 After handing over your{03}ticket, you may board the{03}ship.{02}{00}
#1D1A We will be setting sail{03}shortly; please wait on{03}board.{02}{00}
#1D1B If you have tickets,{03}please give them to him{03}and board the ship.{02}{00}
#1D1C I don't know when we're{03}going to set sail.{03}Please ask the captain.{02}{00}
#1D1D Silk Road is blocked,{03}so the ship is pretty{03}full today.{02}{00}
#1D1E The replacement ship{03}hasn't arrived, so we{03}still can't set sail.{02}{00}
#1D1F Please board the ship and{03}wait to set sail.{02}{00}
#1D20 Do you want to{03}go ashore?{1E}{00}
#1D21 Please pass through.{02}{00}
#1D22 We'll be setting sail{03}soon, so please board{03}the ship.{02}{00}
#1D23 When you're finished{03}out here, please{03}board the ship.{02}{00}
#1D24 There are a lot of{03}passengers... I wonder if{03}we'll be able to set sail.{01}Really, it makes{03}me wonder.{02}{00}
#1D25 The replacement ship from{03}Tolbi should have been{03}here by now...{01}Do you think something{03}happened while they were{03}crossing the Karagol?{02}{00}
#1D26 I wonder what could{03}have happened.{02}{00}
#1D27 You mean you still intend{03}to cross this dangerous{03}sea?{02}{00}
#1D28 It would be too big a loss{03}to let so many passengers{03}get away...{02}{00}
#1D29 Say, Kaja, how are{03}the oarsmen doing?{02}{00}
#1D2A They're fearless. There's{03}no problem there.{01}It's just that...{02}{00}
#1D2B "It's just that"...what?{02}{00}
#1D2C If a whole bunch of...them{03}appear while we're{03}crossing the sea,{01}I won't be able to{03}handle them alone.{02}{00}
#1D2D I'm sorry, but you'll have{03}to. I can't let anyone else{03}fight but you, Kaja.{02}{00}
#1D2E Remember,{05} the oarsmen{03}will have their hands full{03}rowing. They can't fight.{02}{00}
#1D2F Hmmm. What to do...{02}{00}
#1D30 It's too late to hire{03}mercenaries now...{03}There's no time.{02}{00}
#1D31 But we can't send the{03}ship out without hiring{03}some warriors.{02}{00}
#1D32 I wonder if there are{03}any other reliable{03}warriors around.{02}{00}
#1D33 This is a chance to make{03}some money. It'd really be{03}a waste to pass it up.{02}{00}
#1D34 Sending out a ship when{03}it's this dangerous... It's{03}like setting out to die.{02}{00}
#1D35 If we don't set sail now,{03}you would be admitting{03}you were afraid, Kaja...{01}That won't happen.{03}I won't let that happen.{02}{00}
#1D36 I told you, we're{03}leaving soon.{01}We'll set sail when{03}our replacement arrives!{02}{00}
#1D37 If we don't leave{03}soon, Colosso will{03}start without us!{01}Will you accept full{03}responsibility for being{03}late to Colosso?{02}{00}
#1D38 I wonder what's going on.{03}We've been waiting an{03}awfully long time.{02}{00}
#1D39 I wonder if I'm the only{03}one here who's going{03}to Tolbi to see Colosso...{02}{00}
#1D3A The Karagol is like a{03}humongous lake,{03}surrounded by land.{01}So there are no waves,{03}but the water is salty,{03}just like a real ocean.{02}{00}
#1D3B "When are we going?{03}When are we going?"{03}This guy's really pushy.{02}{00}
#1D3C Hmmm. This is so{03}frustrating...{01}Why won't anyone tell{03}me what's going on?{02}{00}
#1D3D Traveling by ship is{03}faster than walking;{03}there's no need to rush.{02}{00}
#1D3E Most of the people going{03}to Colosso set out a{03}long time ago.{02}{00}
#1D3F The Karagol Sea is pretty{03}foggy today. Maybe that's{03}why I'm so uneasy.{02}{00}
#1D40 There's nothing we can{03}do... Let's set sail!{02}{00}
#1D41 Wha-{05}What are you{03}talking about!{01}If we set sail now,{03}we'll never make{03}it to Tolbi.{02}{00}
#1D42 We'll be fine...{03}We have a protective{03}amulet!{02}{00}
#1D43 Amulet...{05} Amulet, you say...{03}You mean that little{03}anchor charm?{02}{00}
#1D44 The little anchor has{03}always protected us{03}from danger.{02}{00}
#1D45 Captain, get ahold of{03}yourself! That's just{03}foolish superstition!{02}{00}
#1D46 It's okay. We'll be fine.{03}Even if we can't find any{03}mercenaries,{01}that little charm will{03}protect us.{02}{00}
#1D47 Now then, let's hurry up!{03}Prepare to set sail!{02}{00}
#1D48 This is great...{05}{03}We'll be setting sail soon!{02}{00}
#1D49 (Not if I have anything{03}to say about it.){02}{00}
#1D4A We apologize for any{03}trouble that this{03}delay has caused.{01}Please relax and enjoy{03}the trip. We will be{03}setting sail very shortly.{02}{00}
#1D4B If it were a legitimate{03}ship, we'd be leaving now.{01}Who knows when we'll{03}reach Tolbi now...{02}{00}
#1D4C There is nothing to fear{03}as long as we have{03}our anchor charm.{01}Are we still getting{03}ready to set sail?{02}{00}
#1D4D There are monsters out{03}there... If we don't{03}prepare, we're doomed!{01}Curses!{03}If only we had some{03}powerful warriors...{02}{00}
#1D4E The longer we sit here,{03}the more time we{03}have to think.{01}I wonder what happened...{03}with our participation{03}in Colosso.{02}{00}
#1D4F Apparently, we can't{03}take Silk Road like{03}we'd planned.{01}So I guess we're the only{03}passengers who could{03}afford the tickets.{02}{00}
#1D50 There's a whole bunch of{03}really muscular men on{03}the floor below.{01}Those people are rowing{03}the oars so the ship{03}moves, right?{02}{00}
#1D51 You're going to Tolbi{03}to see Colosso,{03}too, right?{01}Once you've seen{03}Colosso, you won't want to{03}go to a regular festival.{02}{00}
#1D52 Maybe I should{03}just forget about{03}going...{02}{00}
#1D53 They're just taking{03}advantage of us,{01}selling those tickets{03}for so much money.{02}{00}
#1D54 Muscles rippling{03}everywhere...{03}looks great!{01}If we go to Colosso,{03}there'll be more guys{03}built like that, right?{02}{00}
#1D55 We left the old lady{03}back home. Now we can{03}take our time at Colosso.{02}{00}
#1D56 If we aren't going to set{03}sail right away, I'm going{03}to go ashore!{02}{00}
#1D57 Yeah, but...{05}we're going{03}to set sail real soon,{03}so please be patient.{02}{00}
#1D58 When is "real soon"?{02}{00}
#1D59 I'm asking how long real{03}soon is going to be!{02}{00}
#1D5A You're wondering when.{05}.{05}.{05}{03}Well...{02}{00}
#1D5B We're planning to go{03}see Colosso.{02}{00}
#1D5C You know, my friend{03}Ouranos here is{03}scared of ships.{02}{00}
#1D5D Ouranos? But he's huge!{02}{00}
#1D5E It's not that I'm{03}scared. I just can't{03}stand water...{02}{00}
#1D5F I'd rather be bitten{03}by poisonous spiders{03}than sail across the sea.{02}{00}
#1D60 Hmmm.{05}{03}Spiders, huh?{02}{00}
#1D61 And even Ouranos is{03}ready to cross the{03}sea right now.{02}{00}
#1D62 Well, if we're not going{03}now, then when are we{03}going to set sail?{02}{00}
#1D63 That's...{05}not an{03}easy question.{02}{00}
#1D64 You mean you wouldn't{03}know even if I asked?{02}{00}
#1D65 We're going, Ouranos.{02}{00}
#1D66 Going?{05} Where?{02}{00}
#1D67 Where else? To the{03}captain's quarters,{03}of course.{02}{00}
#1D68 What do you think you're{03}going to do in the{03}captain's quarters?{02}{00}
#1D69 Make him set sail.{02}{00}
#1D6A And what if he refuses? {02}{00}
#1D6B In that case, we'll just{03}have to do our best to{03}{05}persuade{05} him...{01}Right, Ouranos?{02}{00}
#1D6C That sounds crazy!{02}{00}
#1D6D That sounds{05} great!{03}Count me in.{02}{00}
#1D6E I don't want any{03}violence!{02}{00}
#1D6F Somebody stop them...{02}{00}
#1D70 They can't be planning{03}a mutiny...{02}{00}
#1D71 Those warriors got tired{03}of waiting, so they went{03}to see the captain. {02}{00}
#1D72 I wonder if those two{03}are planning on taking{03}over the ship.{02}{00}
#1D73 Ha hah! Those mercenaries{03}are going to yell at the{03}captain for us!{02}{00}
#1D74 Using force to launch the{03}ship? That's going too{03}far...{02}{00}
#1D75 They were just about to{03}launch the ship when...{03}They're awful.{02}{00}
#1D76 Those thugs are too{03}impatient... Trying to{03}launch the ship by force.{02}{00}
#1D77 Hee hee. If we can get{03}moving, I don't care what{03}it takes. I say, go for it!{02}{00}
#1D78 Those guys seem pretty{03}sure of their fighting{03}skills. They can do it.{02}{00}
#1D79 We can leave as soon{03}as we get our orders.{02}{00}
#1D7A Everyone rows in time{03}with this drum.{02}{00}
#1D7B Rowing is a man's job!{02}{00}
#1D7C We're the ones who make{03}the ship move.{02}{00}
#1D7D Once we cast off,{03}you just leave the{03}rest to us.{02}{00}
#1D7E You can only do hard{03}work like this while{03}you're young.{02}{00}
#1D7F Hmmm. I wonder when{03}we're going to launch...{02}{00}
#1D80 I can't wait until{03}we get to Tolbi and I{03}can stretch my wings.{02}{00}
#1D81 I hear there's an isle in{03}the middle of the Karagol,{03}but I've never seen it.{02}{00}
#1D82 From the sea, it looks{03}like Silk Road is{03}totally flooded.{02}{00}
#1D83 Enough is enough!{03}Let's set off!{02}{00}
#1D84 I love it when the{03}oars move in rhythm{03}to my drum.{02}{00}
#1D85 Everyone down here{03}gets so competitive.{02}{00}
#1D86 These big muscles are a{03}sign that we're oarsmen.{02}{00}
#1D87 We'll see to it that they{03}all have a pleasant{03}voyage!{02}{00}
#1D88 You've got to save up{03}lots of cash before you{03}get too old to row...{02}{00}
#1D89 I don't feel like rowing{03}all the way to the coast{03}of Tolbi today.{01}I wonder if this is what{03}a bad premonition feels{03}like.{02}{00}
#1D8A Spend your money while{03}you're young enough{03}to enjoy it!{01}That's the manly{03}thing to do.{02}{00}
#1D8B It seems like there would{03}be buried treasure... It's{03}that kind of island.{02}{00}
#1D8C Ha hah! If you want to go{03}to Tolbi, get on the ship!{02}{00}
#1D8D I didn't do anything...{02}{00}
#1D8E Really, I mean it...{02}{00}
#1D8F Oh!{05} At the risk of{03}sounding repetitive,{03}I didn't do anything!{02}{00}
#1D90 I hid the anchor charm...{01}No one would ever look{03}on top of the mast.{02}{00}
#1D91 Now what? You want to{03}see the captain too?{1E}{00}
#1D92 Well, you don't have{03}any business here then.{03}Off with you now!{02}{00}
#1D93 You're trying to{03}launch the ship?{02}{00}
#1D94 We can't set sail in{03}this dangerous sea!{02}{00}
#1D95 What was that?{02}{00}
#1D96 We don't care about that!{01}We paid our money,{03}and now you have to{03}launch the ship!{02}{00}
#1D97 But the captain decided{03}to set sail just a{03}second ago.{02}{00}
#1D98 So...we're taking off?{02}{00}
#1D99 Yes.{05} Preparations are{03}being made right now.{02}{00}
#1D9A Well...maybe we were a{03}bit rash, running up{03}here like that.{02}{00}
#1D9B Please,{05} launch the ship{03}when you're ready.{02}{00}
#1D9C ...{02}{00}
#1D9D Dangerous sea... That's{03}what you said, isn't it?{02}{00}
#1D9E It's dangerous out there...{03}Is that why you wouldn't{03}launch the ship?{02}{00}
#1D9F Yeah, I did... {05}{03}The sea is dangerous now.{03}There are monsters...{02}{00}
#1DA0 Monsters, you say?{02}{00}
#1DA1 Lately, we've been sighting{03}creatures never before{03}seen in the Karagol.{02}{00}
#1DA2 Dangerous ones?{02}{00}
#1DA3 Actually, some even came{03}onboard the ship and{03}attacked the crew.{02}{00}
#1DA4 That {09}{02}IS{07} dangerous!{02}{00}
#1DA5 We suspect that our{03}replacement ship might{03}have been attacked.{02}{00}
#1DA6 With such dangerous{03}creatures around... You{03}might need warriors!{02}{00}
#1DA7 It is certainly dangerous,{03}but the ship is okay.{03}After all, we{18}{02}{00}
#1DA8 If there are monsters,{03}I'll be glad to{03}help out.{02}{00}
#1DA9 Oh,{05} really?{02}{00}
#1DAA Hey, Ouranos, I thought{18}{02}{00}
#1DAB We have to make it to{03}Colosso...{05} If we're late,{03}we can't enter.{02}{00}
#1DAC That's true, but...{02}{00}
#1DAD Hey, maybe you can give{03}us a hand, too, Sean!{02}{00}
#1DAE Really?{02}{00}
#1DAF Are you really going{03}to help out?{02}{00}
#1DB0 I'm a man of my word.{03}If I said I'll help,{03}I'll help.{02}{00}
#1DB1 With you guys helping me{03}to keep the deck safe,{03}the ship should be okay.{02}{00}
#1DB2 So, can we set off now?{02}{00}
#1DB3 No... Now, we need{03}someone to protect the{03}oarsmen...{02}{00}
#1DB4 Protect the oarsmen, huh?{01}You guys need some{03}warriors...{02}{00}
#1DB5 You have an idea?{02}{00}
#1DB6 I saw some warriors in{03}among the passengers{03}belowdecks.{02}{00}
#1DB7 Do you think they'd{03}help us out?{02}{00}
#1DB8 If they're from Angara,{03}they will.{02}{00}
#1DB9 Hmmm... If they could help{03}out, we'd be unbeatable.{01}And, of course, we still{03}have my lucky anchor...{02}{00}
#1DBA It's gone...{02}{00}
#1DBB It's vanished!{02}{00}
#1DBC What!?{05}{03}The captain's beloved{03}anchor!{02}{00}
#1DBD The anchor...{03}Our good luck charm?{02}{00}
#1DBE Oh, that? What's the big{03}deal? So what if that{03}old trinket's gone.{02}{00}
#1DBF What do you mean,{03}"Oh, that"!?{02}{00}
#1DC0 That anchor's been{03}keeping my ship{03}safe for years!{02}{00}
#1DC1 It's just decorative,{03}right?{02}{00}
#1DC2 Even if we find some{03}warriors, we won't make{03}it without that anchor.{01}We're not leaving!{02}{00}
#1DC3 But you just said{03}we were leaving...{02}{00}
#1DC4 That was when I{03}thought we still{03}had the anchor!{02}{00}
#1DC5 Why all the fuss over{03}a little trinket?{02}{00}
#1DC6 "Little trinket"!?{03}Weren't you listening{03}to what he said?{02}{00}
#1DC7 It's not just a{03}decoration! It's a{03}good luck charm!{02}{00}
#1DC8 This ship doesn't leave{03}until we find it.{02}{00}
#1DC9 (What's the problem?{03}We've got some warriors{03}to help us...){02}{00}
#1DCA (Maybe we shouldn't{03}have taken it.){02}{00}
#1DCB Hey!{05} Hey, you!{03}What are you{03}doing here?{02}{00}
#1DCC You heard the captain{18}{03}This ship goes nowhere!!{02}{00}
#1DCD Oh, of all the bad{03}luck...losing my{03}lucky charm!{01}This ship can't leave{03}until we find it!{02}{00}
#1DCE Right when we found some{03}warriors to protect the{03}ship... Great...{02}{00}
#1DCF I can't believe him...{03}Refusing to leave{03}because of one charm?{02}{00}
#1DD0 I had no idea he{03}was so superstitious.{01}I thought he was joking...{02}{00}
#1DD1 You came to ask the{03}captain to set{03}sail, right?{1E}{00}
#1DD2 If we had worked{03}together, we'd be out{03}at sea right now.{01}But it's too late now...{03}Because of that charm,{03}we're not going anywhere.{02}{00}
#1DD3 Heh heh... In that case,{03}why don't you take{03}a tour of the ship?{01}I may need a hand from{03}you later. I hope you'll{03}help me out.{02}{00}
#1DD4 If the ship from Tolbi{03}had come, I'd feel{03}differently,{01}but at this point,{03}I'm not setting sail!{01}Hmmm... I wonder where{03}that anchor charm went.{02}{00}
#1DD5 The ship won't leave dock{03}until we find that{03}anchor charm.{01}Maybe we should forget{03}about setting off.{02}{00}
#1DD6 This is ridiculous... The{03}ship can't set sail because{03}of a good luck charm?{02}{00}
#1DD7 That thing couldn't have{03}gotten lost on its own...{03}Did somebody hide it?{02}{00}
#1DD8 I don't think anyone would{03}steal that charm... I bet{03}we find it right away.{02}{00}
#1DD9 If the ship doesn't{03}leave soon, we might{03}miss Colosso.{02}{00}
#1DDA I waited too long...{03}I'll get in trouble if{03}I don't come clean.{01}I have to confess that I{03}hid it on top of the mast.{02}{00}
#1DDB Hey!{03}It's my lucky anchor!{02}{00}
#1DDC Well, look at that!{03}Did you find our{03}charm for us?{1E}{00}
#1DDD It was atop the mast?{03}Why there, of all places?{02}{00}
#1DDE I... I don't know what{03}to say... Thank you.{03}Now, we can set sail.{02}{00}
#1DDF You climbed up the mast{03}to see the Crow's Nest,{03}and there it was?{01}How on earth did it{03}get up there?{02}{00}
#1DE0 Thank you so much!{03}Now, I can finally launch{03}this ship.{02}{00}
#1DE1 Boy, that's a relief!{03}Now we can set sail.{03}Right, Captain?{02}{00}
#1DE2 Mmm, not just yet...{02}{00}
#1DE3 Not yet? What's the{03}problem this time?{02}{00}
#1DE4 The Karagol Sea is{03}thick with monsters...{02}{00}
#1DE5 But you don't...{02}{00}
#1DE6 Well, it's just like Sean{03}said. The best we can do{03}is protect the deck.{02}{00}
#1DE7 We need someone to{03}protect the oarsmen.{02}{00}
#1DE8 Sean, you look like you{03}have someone in mind{03}to help us...{02}{00}
#1DE9 Yeah.{02}{00}
#1DEA Someone to help?{03}Who?{02}{00}
#1DEB Those warriors,{03}that's who!{02}{00}
#1DEC They may look young, but{03}each of them is a force{03}to be reckoned with.{02}{00}
#1DED When you put it that{03}way, sure. Why not?{02}{00}
#1DEE I can't argue with that...{02}{00}
#1DEF How about it? You want{03}to join forces with us{03}and help out the ship?{1E}{00}
#1DF0 You lack confidence, but{03}Sean has a lot of faith{03}in you.{02}{00}
#1DF1 With you at our side,{03}we'll be fine. I'm sure{03}you can protect the ship.{02}{00}
#1DF2 If you want to reach{03}Tolbi, you'll give us a{03}hand so we can set sail.{02}{00}
#1DF3 So, you'll help us?{03}That means we can{03}finally set sail.{02}{00}
#1DF4 Oh, good! That means the{03}ship is taking off!{02}{00}
#1DF5 There's just one{03}thing left to do...{02}{00}
#1DF6 Oh, no... Now what?{02}{00}
#1DF7 I need some volunteers to{03}help with the rowing...{03}just in case.{02}{00}
#1DF8 What? Are you going to{03}ask the passengers to{03}help row the ship?{02}{00}
#1DF9 The ship won't move{03}without oarsmen, so...{02}{00}
#1DFA Don't worry{18}we'll do{03}that, too!{02}{00}
#1DFB Wa-{05}Wait a minute...{03}You're supposed to{03}protect the ship!{02}{00}
#1DFC We'll need to ask the{03}other passengers.{02}{00}
#1DFD These passengers are part{03}of your tour, so why{03}don't you go ask them?{02}{00}
#1DFE This is crazy...{02}{00}
#1DFF We need you to help{03}out. Even with the{03}crazy stuff.{02}{00}
#1E00 Well then, let's all go{03}to our stations while we{03}wait for the launch.{02}{00}
#1E01 Come to think of it,{03}I don't know your name.{03}You want to tell me?{1E}{00}
#1E02 Ah, {10}.{05}{03}Well then, {10},{01}I'm looking forward to{03}working with you.{02}{00}
#1E03 Well, I'll need to call{03}you something. Hmm... You{03}look like {10}.{02}{00}
#1E04 Well then, {10}...{02}{00}
#1E05 Well, everybody, let's{03}get this ship to sea!{02}{00}
#1E06 We don't know what might{03}happen before we arrive.{03}Be ready for anything.{02}{00}
#1E07 As long as we have the{03}anchor charm, we have{03}nothing to fear!{02}{00}
#1E08 Now that we have you to{03}protect the ship, we{03}ought to be leaving soon.{01}But I think it might be{03}tough to get the other{03}passengers to row...{02}{00}
#1E09 We'll have to make them{03}promise to help row{03}before we can set sail.{01}Hopefully, it won't come{03}to that, though.{02}{00}
#1E0A If we just promise to{03}help row, the ship will{03}set sail, right?{01}It's pretty easy to make{03}a promise.{02}{00}
#1E0B I'll agree to anything,{03}even rowing the ship,{01}if it means we'll finally{03}leave the dock!{02}{00}
#1E0C That sea dog Kaja is a{03}little scary, so everyone{03}agreed to help row.{01}But fighting up here suits{03}me better than rowing{03}down below!{02}{00}
#1E0D Are you serious about{03}setting sail?{01}I heard a sailor say{03}he'd seen the shadows{03}of monsters in the water.{01}Isn't this going to be{03}a little dangerous?{02}{00}
#1E0E It probably won't make{03}any difference if I make{03}them promise to row...{01}I just hope we don't have{03}to refund their money{03}at the end of the trip.{02}{00}
#1E0F Ultimately, they're just{03}being threatened into{03}helping, right?{01}No matter what happens,{03}I won't force the{03}passengers to work.{02}{00}
#1E10 Besides, rowing is a man's{03}job... Leave me out of it.{02}{00}
#1E11 Us? Help with the rowing?{03}Get serious!{01}There's no way we'd{03}ever do such hard work.{02}{00}
#1E12 You all agreed to help{03}of your own accord.{01}That's why I'd like{03}your total cooperation{03}when the time comes!{02}{00}
#1E13 These proud warriors are{03}not going to like being{03}told to row.{02}{00}
#1E14 What do you think? You{03}guys wanna trade jobs?{1E}{00}
#1E15 You look so scary... You{03}say you want to trade,{03}but it's not that easy.{02}{00}
#1E16 I see. Sure, why don't{03}you take over the rowing.{02}{00}
#1E17 I figured you'd say that.{03}Fine. Rowing is fine{03}with me.{02}{00}
#1E18 All that money on tickets,{03}and now we have to row{03}the ship? Madness!{02}{00}
#1E19 Are you going to row? {1E}{00}
#1E1A Hmmm. So, you have to{03}row, even though you're{03}a fighter, huh?{02}{00}
#1E1B Oh. {05}Helping to protect{03}the ship suits you{03}better, doesn't it?{01}Oh well, it doesn't matter.{03}It's not going to happen.{02}{00}
#1E1C I never thought I'd get to{03}be this age and end up{03}having to row a boat!{02}{00}
#1E1D If something happens{03}to our oarsmen, we'll{03}need the help.{01}If that happens, we'll{03}help out as warriors.{02}{00}
#1E1E Do they honestly think{03}I'm going to help row{03}the ship?{02}{00}
#1E1F I'm sure it'd be easier{03}to protect the ship than{03}it would be to row.{02}{00}
#1E20 Well, shoot! Maybe{03}we should have just{03}stayed in Kalay.{02}{00}
#1E21 Asking the passengers to{03}help out with the rowing...{01}This trip is going to{03}be plagued with problems.{02}{00}
#1E22 O, Master of the Sea,{03}protect this ship...{02}{00}
#1E23 I'll watch the seas. You{03}guys help Kaja and his{03}crew with any monsters.{02}{00}
#1E24 Yow! Those guys keep{03}staring at me...{01}I wonder if they figured{03}out I was the one{03}who hid the anchor.{02}{00}
#1E25 So, some oarsmen were{03}injured, huh?{01}No, no, I'm the lookout.{03}You need to ask someone{03}else.{02}{00}
#1E26 The lookout? But the{03}sea is so vast, how can{03}you spot anything?{02}{00}
#1E27 Our replacement never{03}arrived, but we're shoving{03}off just the same.{02}{00}
#1E28 What about the sea{03}monsters? Who's going to{03}be protecting the ship?{02}{00}
#1E29 That'll be me,{03}Ouranos, and Sean on{03}deck, and...{02}{00}
#1E2A {11}{01} and his{03}friends protecting{03}you down here.{02}{00}
#1E2B Can we really depend{03}on them?{02}{00}
#1E2C {11}{01} and his friends{03}have seen more combat{03}than even I have,{01}so there's nothing{03}to worry about.{02}{00}
#1E2D If you say so, Kaja.{03}We trust your judgment.{02}{00}
#1E2E And what will you do if{03}any of you becomes{03}incapacitated?{02}{00}
#1E2F We're not sure...{03}What happens then??{02}{00}
#1E30 Another passenger will{03}help row the ship.{02}{00}
#1E31 Don't worry about it!{03}I had a word with{03}the passengers.{02}{00}
#1E32 Who will go and{03}give the order when{03}the time comes?{02}{00}
#1E33 Hmmm.{05} Good point...{02}{00}
#1E34 You should select a{03}replacement and bring{03}him here.{02}{00}
#1E35 Rowing requires teamwork.{01}Be sure to balance the{03}two teams.{02}{00}
#1E36 That's right. If we're not{03}balanced, we won't make{03}much progress.{02}{00}
#1E37 Right. You have{03}your orders.{02}{00}
#1E38 I trust you'll all{03}do your best.{02}{00}
#1E39 Preparations...{05} Ready!{02}{00}
#1E3A Ship's course...{05} Clear!{02}{00}
#1E3B All right. Cast off!{02}{00}
#1E3C Row those oars!{02}{00}
#1E3D All right, we're off!{02}{00}
#1E3E Avast!{02}{00}
#1E3F Monsters sighted!{02}{00}
#1E40 Monsters?{02}{00}
#1E41 Aye, Captain!{03}Sea monsters!{02}{00}
#1E42 Captain, turn the rudder{03}hard to starboard!{02}{00}
#1E43 All right, I'm turning!{02}{00}
#1E44 It's no use. It's too late!{02}{00}
#1E45 {09}{04}Arrgh!{02}{00}
#1E46 Monsters belowdecks!{02}{00}
#1E47 {11}{01}! Take care of{03}these beasts and save{03}my mates!{02}{00}
#1E48 Where are you going,{03}{11}{01}? Slay the beasts{03}and save my mates!{02}{00}
#1E49 Monsters!{02}{00}
#1E4A Monsters from the deep{03}are attacking, just as the{03}captain feared!{02}{00}
#1E4B Curse those beasts!{03}They got one of our{03}oarsmen!{02}{00}
#1E4C We oarsmen may be{03}strong, but we're no{03}match for sea monsters!{02}{00}
#1E4D Fighting off the monsters{03}is your job. Hurry up{03}and take care of 'em!{02}{00}
#1E4E {09}{04}Foul beast! I may be{03}trembling...{01}{09}{04}But I'm trembling with{03}anticipation!{03}Go get 'em, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#1E4F If I weren't so tired, I'd{03}beat down those monsters{03}without breaking a sweat!{02}{00}
#1E50 Curses! I want to smack{03}that monster with my oar.{01}...But if my oar breaks,{03}I won't be able to row...{02}{00}
#1E51 Who is that thing{03}going to grab next?{02}{00}
#1E52 If you don't do a better{03}job protecting us, there{03}won't be any oarsmen left!{02}{00}
#1E53 Why aren't you doing{03}anything to stop that{03}monster?{02}{00}
#1E54 If we lose any more{03}oarsmen, it will slow{03}the ship.{02}{00}
#1E55 We don't even know if{03}attacking the beasts will{03}do any good.{02}{00}
#1E56 If the sea monsters get{03}us, we won't be able to{03}keep rowing.{02}{00}
#1E57 I'm scared. Those sea{03}monsters are{03}terrifying.{05} {09}{04}Mommy!{02}{00}
#1E58 Fighting sea monsters is{03}for warriors. I want{03}nothing to do with it!{02}{00}
#1E59 The sea monsters are so{03}tough, a blow from an oar{03}wouldn't leave a mark.{02}{00}
#1E5A I don't care who else the{03}monster gets...{03}Just save me!{02}{00}
#1E5B Please! Just stay here{03}and protect me!{02}{00}
#1E5C {09}{04}We're surrounded by{03}danger on all sides, but{03}they still make us row!{01}Please! Finish these vile{03}beasts off!{02}{00}
#1E5D {09}{04}Ahhhh! Sea monsters!{03}Real, live sea monsters!{01}I thought I'd seen every{03}type of monster there is,{03}but this one's new to me!{02}{00}
#1E5E {09}{04}Wha{18}{05} Hey, you! This is{03}no time to start a{03}conversation!{02}{00}
#1E5F {09}{04}Aah! {05} I have to row this{03}ship because of you!{01}And now a sea monster{03}is going to eat me!{02}{00}
#1E60 {09}{04}H{05}-Hey, {11}{01}, shouldn't{03}you be moving a{03}bit faster?{02}{00}
#1E61 {09}{04}Yaaahhh! I-I'm not afraid{03}of monsters one bit!{01}But I'm just an oarsman,{03}now, not a warrior!{02}{00}
#1E62 {09}{04}The oarsmen are in dire{03}straights! Stomp and kick{03}those monsters!{02}{00}
#1E63 {09}{04}I{05}-I can't do this! Fighting{03}off sea monsters isn't{03}in my job description!{02}{00}
#1E64 {09}{04}I don't care what happens{03}now. I just want to quit{03}rowing.{02}{00}
#1E65 Sea monsters are{03}terribly ferocious!{02}{00}
#1E66 If I were a warrior,{03}I wouldn't let a monster{03}like this take over!{02}{00}
#1E67 I wonder if this warrior{03}has enough confidence to{03}defeat a monster.{02}{00}
#1E68 We're sure in a fix.{03}Say, you're going to row{03}next, aren't you?{02}{00}
#1E69 I'm so out of my wits,{03}I don't even know how{03}frightened I am.{02}{00}
#1E6A These sea monsters look{03}awfully strong!{01}I'd rather be an{03}oarsman than have{03}to fight them!{02}{00}
#1E6B Please, oh please, let{03}me make it out{03}of this alive!{02}{00}
#1E6C Why did sea monsters{03}have to appear just when{03}I get on board?{02}{00}
#1E6D I'd rather be eaten by{03}a sea monster than have{03}to row this ship.{02}{00}
#1E6E Hey, are you OK?{02}{00}
#1E6F Looks like you took care{03}of those sea monsters.{02}{00}
#1E70 We're missing an oarsman!{02}{00}
#1E71 Oh no!{05} He's unconscious!{02}{00}
#1E72 It looks like the sea{03}monsters got one{03}of our rowers...{02}{00}
#1E73 There's no way{03}around it...{01}{11}{01}{05}, go ask one of{03}the passengers to row,{03}OK?{1E}{00}
#1E74 Hop to it!{02}{00}
#1E75 Look, I know you don't{03}want to have to do this,{03}but you promised...{02}{00}
#1E76 Now, bring a passenger{03}who can help row.{02}{00}
#1E77 You must feel awfully{03}important, ordering people{03}around like this!{01}I have a job to do.{03}I can't row!{02}{00}
#1E78 {09}{04}Nooooo!{05}{07} You're not going{03}to make me row, are you?{1E}{00}
#1E79 I've never done much{03}physical labor, but if I{03}must{05}, then I guess I must.{02}{00}
#1E7A I'm just a businessman.{03}I'm not strong enough{03}to be of any use.{02}{00}
#1E7B You...{05} You must be joking.{03}You want me to row?{1E}{00}
#1E7C You jerk! What do you{03}have against me?{02}{00}
#1E7D Ye{05}-Yeah. Besides, a{03}spatula suits me{03}better than an oar.{02}{00}
#1E7E Don't tell me{05} you're going{03}to ask a lady to row?{1E}{00}
#1E7F What?{05} I don't believe this.{05}{03}You're evil! A monster!{03}I won't forget this!{02}{00}
#1E80 You startled me, sir.{03}Don't frighten me{03}like that!{02}{00}
#1E81 What? {09}{04}Ohhhh, noooo...{05}{03}{07}Are you going to{03}make me row?{1E}{00}
#1E82 Huh?{05} You DO want me{03}to row?{01}Okay, okay. I'm going{03}already. But I'm not gonna{03}forget this! You...{02}{00}
#1E83 What?{05} You're not going{03}to pick me? You really{03}are a nice guy!{02}{00}
#1E84 Ha ha ha. Rowing, right?{03}Feel free to choose{03}whomever you like.{02}{00}
#1E85 What?{05} Me? You must be{03}joking! Really?{1E}{00}
#1E86 {09}{04}Awwwww!{05}{07} Oh, this is{03}just too much to{03}handle.{02}{00}
#1E87 Phew! Don't frighten me{03}like that!{02}{00}
#1E88 Hey!{05} You're not thinking{03}of making me an oarsman,{03}are you?{1E}{00}
#1E89 Grrr...{05} I can't believe{03}this guy is actually{03}choosing me.{01}Assigning such menial work{03}to a proud person like{03}me is going too far!{02}{00}
#1E8A Heh-heh!{05} Not picking{03}me is a smart choice,{03}buddy.{02}{00}
#1E8B What?{05} Me? An oarsman?{03}Give me a break!{03}Seriously?{1E}{00}
#1E8C Oh, you are serious...{03}Fine! I'll do it...{02}{00}
#1E8D Hahhh... {05}You scared me so{03}bad, my heart nearly{03}stopped!{02}{00}
#1E8E That poor oarsman. I feel{03}so sorry for him.{01}What?{05} You want me to{03}take his place?{1E}{00}
#1E8F How can you ask a young{03}lady to take his place?{03}It's not fair!!!{02}{00}
#1E90 That's right... You can't{03}ask a proper lady to{03}do such a filthy job!{02}{00}
#1E91 Out of all these people,{03}you're asking a frail old{03}man like me to row?{1E}{00}
#1E92 You'll regret this when{03}I collapse from{03}exhaustion or something!{02}{00}
#1E93 Th... {05}That's right...{03}Nobody would ever{03}choose me.{02}{00}
#1E94 An oarsman was injured{03}by a sea monster?{01}I'm just glad I'm not{03}the one who has to{03}take his place!{02}{00}
#1E95 Nobody would choose me...{03}After all, I'm the tour{03}group's guide!{02}{00}
#1E96 Hey! Looks like they need{03}someone to help row...{03}Don't look over here!{02}{00}
#1E97 Rowing is a tough job,{05}{03}isn't it?{05}{03}It's not for me!{02}{00}
#1E98 Hey! This guy's been{03}staring at me the whole{03}trip... Maybe he likes me.{02}{00}
#1E99 Oh!{05} Oh, no! He's not{03}coming to ask me to{03}row, is he?{02}{00}
#1E9A Please, please... {05}{03}I'm begging! Just don't{03}let him choose me.{02}{00}
#1E9B What's with you!? Go{03}bother the men, why don't{03}you? Tsk!{02}{00}
#1E9C Why am I getting so{03}worked up over this?{01}There's no way he'd{03}choose a decrepit old man{03}like me, is there?{02}{00}
#1E9D We had enough trouble{03}just getting passengers!{01}It's not like we have{03}extra oarsmen.{02}{00}
#1E9E Looks like you've been{03}chosen to help row,{03}doesn't it?{01}So, get on with{03}the rowing!{02}{00}
#1E9F Ha ha ha!{05}{03}Chosen to be an{03}oarsman, huh?{02}{00}
#1EA0 So you finally picked{03}someone, didn't you?{03}Show your stuff!{02}{00}
#1EA1 It gives me chills to{03}think that could have{03}been me.{02}{00}
#1EA2 Hey, {11}{01}. You've got{03}a good eye!{02}{00}
#1EA3 That's who you picked{03}to be an oarsman?{01}Good choice!{03}...Looks very...oarsman{05}ly.{02}{00}
#1EA4 If you've chosen an{03}oarsman, let's get{03}to rowing!{02}{00}
#1EA5 You've been chosen as{03}an oarsman? Aye, now{03}that's an honor!{02}{00}
#1EA6 Ho ho! Is that person{03}going to get us to Tolbi?{02}{00}
#1EA7 You make me nervous{03}just standing there,{03}looking for oarsmen.{02}{00}
#1EA8 I've been in a cold sweat{03}thinking they were going{03}to choose me!{02}{00}
#1EA9 Oh, this poor sap looks{03}sad enough to break out{03}in tears right here!{02}{00}
#1EAA Oh, no. No...{03}When our eyes met, I{03}knew that was it.{02}{00}
#1EAB It's only natural that I{03}not be chosen.{02}{00}
#1EAC I snuck by this time...{03}But what about next time?{02}{00}
#1EAD Wow... This warrior isn't{03}gonna let anyone off easy!{03}I'm glad it's not me.{02}{00}
#1EAE You can just move{03}right along with that{03}person.{02}{00}
#1EAF Careful now, watch out...{05}{03}Don't make eye contact.{03}Turn the other way.{02}{00}
#1EB0 It looks like another{03}oarsman was injured...{01}We have to pick a{03}replacement from among{03}the passengers.{02}{00}
#1EB1 I feel sorry for the{03}oarsmen who were{03}injured.{01}Let's see to it that{03}no one else gets{03}hurt, OK, {11}{01}?{02}{00}
#1EB2 An oarsman was injured?{02}{00}
#1EB3 There's no time to worry.{03}We must escape the{03}waters of the Karagol!{02}{00}
#1EB4 We have no idea when{03}those sea monsters{03}might attack again.{01}Curses! I won't let them{03}have their way with us{03}any longer!{02}{00}
#1EB5 Uhnnn. When I look at{03}the water, I feel sick.{01}I wonder how long I can{03}fight in this condition...{02}{00}
#1EB6 We knew the risks when{03}we set out...{01}But it always hurts{03}to see a crewman get{03}injured.{02}{00}
#1EB7 {11}{01}, you're back.{02}{00}
#1EB8 Hey!{05} Where's the{03}replacement for our{03}injured oarsman?{02}{00}
#1EB9 What? You didn't choose{03}an oarsman?{02}{00}
#1EBA This ship won't go{03}anywhere without{03}enough oarsmen!{02}{00}
#1EBB I'm sorry, but you're{03}going to have to choose{03}someone!{02}{00}
#1EBC {11}{01}, you're back!{03}And you brought an{03}oarsman with you!{02}{00}
#1EBD Well, you're going to{03}have to row for us.{02}{00}
#1EBE All right. Take your{03}place.{02}{00}
#1EBF Now, we'll need you to{03}protect this area{03}again, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#1EC0 If we don't leave{03}soon...{02}{00}
#1EC1 I wonder what's wrong...{05}{03}The ship shouldn't be{03}rocking this badly.{02}{00}
#1EC2 {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#1EC3 {11}{01}, up on deck!{02}{00}
#1EC4 {11}{01}, there's a{03}huge sea monster on{03}the ship!{02}{00}
#1EC5 If we don't do something...{03}we'll sink! You have{03}to help us!{02}{00}
#1EC6 If this ship sinks,{03}everything we've done{03}will mean nothing...{01}Let's go bag us some{03}sea monsters.{02}{00}
#1EC7 Imagine the size of that{03}beast!{01}Is it even possible{03}to slay such a thing?{02}{00}
#1EC8 How can these sea{03}monsters keep coming one{03}after the other.{02}{00}
#1EC9 Judging from Kaja's{03}reaction, it must be{03}a fearsome beast...{02}{00}
#1ECA Kaja wouldn't ask for{03}help unless it was{03}serious.{02}{00}
#1ECB The whole ship is rocking!{03}That monster must be{03}gigantic!{02}{00}
#1ECC We're okay. With you{03}here, we can handle{03}anything.{02}{00}
#1ECD If the ship sinks,{03}we're finished.{02}{00}
#1ECE That thing has Kaja and{03}his men worried. It's{03}going to be a tough fight.{02}{00}
#1ECF Monsters everywhere, and{03}I'm stuck rowing... I{03}should have stayed home!{02}{00}
#1ED0 The ship is starting to{03}list... If we don't do{03}something, she'll sink!{02}{00}
#1ED1 How many monsters are{03}out there?{02}{00}
#1ED2 Another monster? This{03}isn't the first-class{03}passage I paid for!{02}{00}
#1ED3 Owww! My hands are{03}raw from rowing.{02}{00}
#1ED4 Why is he down here?{03}Shouldn't he be fighting{03}the monsters on deck?{02}{00}
#1ED5 What the...? How many{03}monsters does this make?{02}{00}
#1ED6 What kind of monster is{03}rocking this ship? I really{03}want to go take a look...{02}{00}
#1ED7 We're running low on{03}oarsmen, and I'm{03}getting nervous.{02}{00}
#1ED8 I'm taking a little break{03}until they've defeated{03}the sea monsters.{02}{00}
#1ED9 Good thing we have{03}some strong fighters{03}on this ship.{02}{00}
#1EDA I wonder if the monster{03}is big enough to sink{03}the ship.{02}{00}
#1EDB I don't care what it{03}takes, just hurry up{03}and slay that beast!{02}{00}
#1EDC If those monsters come{03}back...go teach{03}'em another lesson!{02}{00}
#1EDD The boat's rocking so{03}much. I'm certain{03}we're doomed!{02}{00}
#1EDE I had no idea there were{03}so many monsters out{03}at sea...{02}{00}
#1EDF We're surrounded by{03}monsters, and still there's{03}no sign of land!{02}{00}
#1EE0 I wonder if they'll make{03}us row again once they've{03}taken care of that beast.{02}{00}
#1EE1 Thank you, {11}{01}.{03}You did good against{03}that Kraken.{02}{00}
#1EE2 We lost another{03}oarsman, though.{02}{00}
#1EE3 I need to check the hull.{03}Go find someone to{03}row the ship.{02}{00}
#1EE4 Land ho!{02}{00}
#1EE5 Hey,{05} I can see land!{02}{00}
#1EE6 It looks like we made it!{02}{00}
#1EE7 We made it?{05} Finally!{03}We're lucky to be alive{03}after all those attacks!{02}{00}
#1EE8 The other passengers have{03}already disembarked...{03}Didn't even say good-bye.{02}{00}
#1EE9 We don't have to row{03}anymore? Oh, what a{03}relief!{02}{00}
#1EEA Ohhh! I haven't had a{03}workout like that in{03}years!{02}{00}
#1EEB Rowing the ship was more{03}fun than I expected!{03}I'm pretty buff now!{02}{00}
#1EEC I totally lost out... An{03}ocean cruise, and I didn't{03}get to enjoy the view!{02}{00}
#1EED You make an old man{03}row the ship, then you{03}try to beat him onshore?{01}That's pretty pathetic.{02}{00}
#1EEE Thanks for all{03}your hard work.{02}{00}
#1EEF Your efforts got this{03}ship to shore.{02}{00}
#1EF0 I thank you again.{02}{00}
#1EF1 Hurry, everyone! Colosso{03}is already underway{03}in Tolbi!{02}{00}
#1EF2 You'd better get moving{03}to Tolbi, too.{02}{00}
#1EF3 I don't think anyone{03}will be crossing the{03}Karagol for a while...{01}The oarsmen won't work{03}for us anymore.{02}{00}
#1EF4 You folks really{03}fought well.{02}{00}
#1EF5 A lot of oarsmen were{03}injured on this{03}voyage.{01}Nobody's going to want to{03}row until things calm{03}down in the Karagol Sea.{02}{00}
#1EF6 Are we safe? It's all{03}because you defeated{03}those monsters!{02}{00}
#1EF7 I've been an oarsman all{03}my life, but this last job{03}was the worst ever!{02}{00}
#1EF8 You go on ahead. Just{03}when it looked like{03}everything was all right,{01}my back went out, and{03}now I can't move.{02}{00}
#1EF9 We can't find anyone to{03}replace our old oarsmen.{02}{00}
#1EFA I'm just glad the Kraken{03}didn't hurt me.{02}{00}
#1EFB Sure, the pay's good, but{03}it doesn't mean a thing if{03}you get hurt on the job.{02}{00}
#1EFC {11}{01} and his pals{03}we're so daring,{03}fighting back there.{02}{00}
#1EFD I feel better now. I was{03}just so scared when I{03}was rowing.{02}{00}
#1EFE I'm in no rush, anyway...{03}This might be the last{03}time I get on a ship.{02}{00}
#1EFF You lookin' for Sean and{03}Ouranos? They left for{03}Tolbi with that tour.{01}I figure they're headed{03}for Colosso.{02}{00}
#1F00 Are you headed for{03}Colosso, too?{1E}{00}
#1F01 I thought so. Most people{03}coming at this time of{03}year usually are.{01}There was this group of{03}six we ferried across{03}a while back.{01}Now they were strange.{02}{00}
#1F02 You came all this way,{03}and you're not going{03}to Colosso?{01}That old guy's group,{03}those six weirdos, and{03}now you...{01}You guys are strange!{02}{00}
#1F03 This group that came on{03}our last voyage pulled{03}some strange stunts.{01}Actually, I was sorta{03}spying on them.{02}{00}
#1F04 I want Sean and Ouranos{03}to do well at Colosso{03}this year,{01}but they don't stand a{03}chance if {11}{01}{03}enters the contest.{02}{00}
#1F05 I'm just going to hang out{03}in Tolbi and enjoy myself{03}for a while.{02}{00}
#1F06 I wonder what happened{03}to that strange group{03}that went on to Tolbi.{02}{00}
#1F07 When the waters are this{03}dangerous, you just can't{03}take to the seas.{01}I think I'll check out{03}Colosso while we think{03}about what to do next.{02}{00}
#1F08 See? Our ship survived{03}an attack and crossed{03}the sea safely.{01}It just proves how{03}effective that lucky{03}anchor really is!{02}{00}
#1F09 I hear you had a scary{03}trip. You even got{03}attacked by a monster!{1E}{00}
#1F0A I wonder why the sea is{03}so dangerous all of{03}a sudden...{02}{00}
#1F0B And you fought off all{03}those monsters alone?{03}...No way!{01}Everyone knows that Kaja{03}was the one who killed{03}the Kraken!{02}{00}
#1F0C Sigh...{05} I think we're{03}done sailing for a while.{01}We've already lost one{03}ship... What else can{03}we do?{02}{00}
#1F0D I guess we won't be{03}seeing anyone back home{03}in Angara for a while.{02}{00}
#1F0E I think that missing ship{03}must have run into the{03}Kraken...{02}{00}
#1F0F I'm sorry, but we just{03}can't sell any tickets{03}right now.{01}The sea is too dangerous,{03}so we've had to cancel{03}all crossings.{02}{00}
#1F10 We rented out our house{03}for Colosso, and now the{03}ship's not launching!{01}If the ship isn't crossing,{03}we can't take our trip!{02}{00}
#1F11 We rented out our house.{03}If the ship won't sail,{03}where will we sleep?{02}{00}
#1F12 Sigh. We could have made{03}lots of money on those{03}tickets. Bad luck, I guess.{02}{00}
#1F13 Maybe we'll stay here{03}until the ship leaves.{02}{00}
#1F14 Are we supposed to{03}sleep on the floor until{03}they set sail again?{02}{00}
#1F15 The tourists look a{03}little upset. Did they{03}get seasick?{1E}{00}
#1F16 The sea was calm, but{03}that monster sure gave{03}them a rough ride.{02}{00}
#1F17 The ship was attacked by{03}monsters? It came within{03}inches of sinking? Wow!{02}{00}
#1F18 Silk Road was blocked,{03}so I thought my parents{03}might come by ship.{01}I don't see them{03}anywhere, though...{02}{00}
#1F19 What's that?{05} You have{03}a message for me from{03}my parents?{1E}{00}
#1F1A Oh, they couldn't make{03}it because the tickets{03}were too expensive?{01}Thank you for letting{03}me know!{02}{00}
#1F1B Oh... I hope nothing{03}awful's happened to{03}them...{02}{00}
#1F1C Thank you for giving{03}me the message{03}from my parents.{02}{00}
#1F1D If you're going to Tolbi,{03}keep heading west.{03}It's not too far.{02}{00}
#1F1E It's been quite some time{03}since the Colosso Tour{03}passengers left for Tolbi.{02}{00}
#1F1F After seeing the looks on{03}the passengers' faces,{01}I don't feel like{03}waiting for my ship{03}anymore.{02}{00}
#1F20 It was a hard crossing...{03}Very risky. I'm glad{03}they didn't come...{02}{00}
#1F21 I get the feeling that it{03}will be a long time before{03}the next sea crossing.{02}{00}
#1F22 You crossed the sea just{03}for Colosso? ...That was{03}a big undertaking!{02}{00}
#1F23 Hmm... {05} So we've finally{03}reached Tolbi, huh?{02}{00}
#1F24 Umm... No.{01}That doesn't look like{03}Tolbi's coast.{02}{00}
#1F25 We must be off course.{03}I don't recognize this{03}place.{02}{00}
#1F26 You're right...{03}That looks like an island.{02}{00}
#1F27 Hmm... Maybe we should{03}stop for a minute.{02}{00}
#1F28 We need time to check{03}the ship's position...{01}Let's head for that{03}island and get our{03}bearings.{02}{00}
#1F29 We've reached the island!{05}{03}Rowers, rest those{03}weary arms!{02}{00}
#1F2A Island? Isn't this{03}Tolbi?{02}{00}
#1F2B What do you mean, island?{03}Aren't we in Tolbi?{02}{00}
#1F2C Uh... Tolbi's not an island,{03}is it?{02}{00}
#1F2D The ship went off course,{03}and we're... Well, we're{03}not sure where we are.{01}We've come to this{03}island so we can get our{03}bearings.{02}{00}
#1F2E Raise your oars and rest{03}for a little while.{02}{00}
#1F2F I'm going to check on{03}the other passengers.{02}{00}
#1F30 If the ship isn't going{03}anywhere, I'm not{03}waiting down here.{01}Let's take a break{03}out front.{02}{00}
#1F31 If I'm not rowing,{03}I ain't staying here.{01}I'm gonna go take{03}my break out front.{02}{00}
#1F32 As long as we're stopping,{03}I don't have to stay{03}in here.{01}It's time for my break.{02}{00}
#1F33 I've been sailing for{03}many years, and I've{03}never seen this island!{02}{00}
#1F34 Wow!{05} I have a blister{03}on my drumming hand...{02}{00}
#1F35 I wonder if it's okay to{03}leave the ship here...{02}{00}
#1F36 Stopping again and again{03}like this is harder than{03}rowing all day long.{02}{00}
#1F37 Let's see, islands in{03}the Karagol Sea...{05}{05}{03}Hmmm...just thinking.{02}{00}
#1F38 When we're rowing, we{03}can just sit and{03}space out, but...{01}It makes me nervous,{03}just sitting here{03}and not rowing.{02}{00}
#1F39 It's crazy to have{03}inexperienced passengers{03}rowing the ship.{02}{00}
#1F3A It was hard for me all{03}the way across the sea.{02}{00}
#1F3B I sure hope another{03}monster doesn't attack...{02}{00}
#1F3C Looks like I'm going to{03}have sore muscles for the{03}first time in a while...{02}{00}
#1F3D Could this be that island{05}{03}that's rumored to have{03}buried treasure?{01}Even if it is, I'm too{03}scared of monsters to{03}leave the ship.{02}{00}
#1F3E Maybe it's time for{03}me to retire...{02}{00}
#1F3F You can't go onto the{03}island! It's too dangerous!{01}What if there are{03}monsters?{02}{00}
#1F40 But there were monsters{03}at sea, so shouldn't it{03}be safer on land?{02}{00}
#1F41 We've been cooped up{03}on that ship too long.{01}We're near land, so let{03}us stretch our legs!{02}{00}
#1F42 There could be monsters{03}here, so leaving the{03}ship might be dangerous.{02}{00}
#1F43 The ship keeps shaking...{03}She can't take much more!{01}I want to plant my feet{03}firmly on land!{02}{00}
#1F44 Why should we have to{03}wait on this tiny boat?{02}{00}
#1F45 If there are monsters,{03}I'm not going anywhere.{02}{00}
#1F46 I don't hear the{03}passengers screaming to{03}get off the boat.{02}{00}
#1F47 I don't feel so well..{03}Don't talk to me...{02}{00}
#1F48 I hate arguing...{02}{00}
#1F49 What to do...{03}I'm worried about the{03}passenger's safety,{02}{00}
#1F4A but why should we stay{03}onboard when there's land{03}right in front of us?{02}{00}
#1F4B I'm sick of this ship...{03}I'm going ashore.{02}{00}
#1F4C Land monsters, I can{03}handle; sea monsters are{03}all slimy and icky...{02}{00}
#1F4D I've been wobbling on{03}this boat for so long I{03}can hardly stand!{02}{00}
#1F4E Go ahead, try and stop{03}me! I'm going ashore!!!{02}{00}
#1F4F Just don't make me face{03}that disgusting Kraken{03}again...{02}{00}
#1F50 So...anyone know if{03}there are any monsters{03}out there?{02}{00}
#1F51 Ohh, that's creepy...{02}{00}
#1F52 In a perfect world, there{03}wouldn't be any monsters{03}waiting to pounce on me...{02}{00}
#1F53 {10}, don't talk{03}like that.{05} Shouldn't we{03}listen to them?{1E}{00}
#1F54 Kaja and the captain are{03}professionals.{01}We ought to trust them{03}and wait, like they said.{02}{00}
#1F55 {11}{01}, you talked{03}to the passengers,{03}didn't you?{01}The tour group is arguing{03}about whether they should{03}leave the ship.{02}{00}
#1F56 We'd like to go ashore{03}and see if it's safe{03}out there...{01}But we promised we'd{03}protect the ship.{02}{00}
#1F57 ...That's it! {05} {11}{01}!{01}Can you go check out the{03}island and see if there{03}are any monsters?{1E}{00}
#1F58 The passengers all seem{03}to be upset, so let's try{03}to do as they ask.{02}{00}
#1F59 That's right. We have to{03}do something, or there'll{03}be no resolving this.{02}{00}
#1F5A It would be fun to{03}explore the island!{03}What do you say, {11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#1F5B I see, you're going to go{03}for me, aren't you?{01}I'm sure no one will{03}complain if we scout out{03}the island.{02}{00}
#1F5C There's no telling what{03}kind of monsters are{03}lurking on this island...{01}Be extremely careful!{02}{00}
#1F5D We've done a good job{03}of keeping the ship{03}safe so far!{01}{11}{01}, you can{03}leave everything to us{03}while you're away.{02}{00}
#1F5E I want to be a sailor{03}like Kaja, reading the{03}wind and the waves...{02}{00}
#1F5F I give up! What are{03}we supposed to do?{02}{00}
#1F60 That's enough bickering...{02}{00}
#1F61 This island gives me the{03}creeps...{02}{00}
#1F62 What we can do now{03}is to protect this ship...{02}{00}
#1F63 Be careful{18}there{03}could be monsters{03}anywhere around here.{02}{00}
#1F64 You'd be surprised, the{03}kinds of treasure you can{03}find on islands like these.{02}{00}
#1F65 We may have taken the{03}wrong route, but we've{03}made a lot of progress.{02}{00}
#1F66 We're looking into the{03}ship's position. It'll be{03}a bit longer.{02}{00}
#1F67 I'm really surprised that{03}there is an island like{03}this in the Karagol Sea.{02}{00}
#1F68 The wind's direction and{03}the high seas... We've{03}got to be close to Tolbi.{02}{00}
#1F69 How was it, {11}{01}?{05}{03}Did you explore the{03}island thoroughly?{1E}{00}
#1F6A If we don't decide if we{03}can go ashore, they'll{03}never stop whining.{01}...I hate to ask you, but{03}would you go exploring{03}one more time?{02}{00}
#1F6B Well...{05} Did you see any{03}monsters out there?{1E}{00}
#1F6C ...I see.{05} Then we can't{03}let the tourists go{03}ashore after all?{02}{00}
#1F6D If there aren't any{03}monsters,{05} I guess we can{03}let the tourists out!{02}{00}
#1F6E The passengers are going{03}stir crazy! They're out{03}of control!{01}You're going to have{03}to let the passengers{03}go ashore.{02}{00}
#1F6F There's no need for that.{02}{00}
#1F70 We figured out the{03}course to Tolbi.{02}{00}
#1F71 Really? We can go?{02}{00}
#1F72 Let's go to Tolbi before{03}the sea gets any rougher.{01}Tell our tourists they{03}can enjoy a nice, long{03}break after we arrive.{02}{00}
#1F73 It's too late...{03}Nothing we can say will{03}calm them down.{02}{00}
#1F74 If we hurry, we can make{03}it to Colosso in time.{02}{00}
#1F75 I see!{05} If we can get{03}them to Colosso, they'll{03}all be happy.{02}{00}
#1F76 All right then, go and{03}tell the tourists.{02}{00}
#1F77 It's not much farther.{03}I'll ask the oarsmen to{03}work 'til the very end.{02}{00}
#1F78 Sorry, everyone{05}, but{03}we need to switch the{03}left and right teams!{01}We've strayed off{03}course because the left{03}team's timing is off.{02}{00}
#1F79 One last push should{03}get us there. Give it{03}all you've got, people!{02}{00}
#1F7A All right!{05} Let's aim for{03}Tolbi and set off one{03}last time!{02}{00}
#1F7B I'm spreading goodwill{03}wherever I travel.{02}{00}
#1F7C Even though I'm opposed{03}to violence, I'm looking{03}forward to Colosso.{02}{00}
#1F7D The ship's crew is ready{03}for anything, and I'll{03}be right here for them.{01}Ask the others to do{03}the rowing.{02}{00}
#1F7E I can't row, but I am{03}hoping for the ship's{03}safe arrival.{02}{00}
#1F7F The ship's crew is ready{03}for anything, and I'll{03}be right here for them.{01}Ask the others to do{03}the rowing.{02}{00}
#1F80 Is this cruel ordeal{03}part of some plan fate{03}has in store for me?{02}{00}
#1F81 It is good that the ship{03}has arrived safely.{02}{00}
#1F82 We made it to Colosso{03}in time... That's good.{02}{00}
#1F83 The ship won't be leaving{03}here... There are too{03}many monsters at sea.{01}This ship isn't going{03}anywhere for a while.{02}{00}
#1F84 Ahhh. I'm bored...{05} When{03}are we going out{03}to sea again?{02}{00}
#1F85 The ship hasn't returned,{03}so we couldn't set off{03}even if we wanted to.{02}{00}
#1F86 Oh ho ho! Without a ship,{03}we can't do any business...{02}{00}
#1F87 I'm glad I only work on{03}the docks...but I am{03}worried about the others.{02}{00}
#1F88 I wonder if monsters{03}got everyone.{02}{00}
#1F89 Incredible! So this is the{03}ocean Kraden was talking{03}about!{02}{00}
#1F8A The Karagol is surrounded{03}by land,{05} so technically,{03}it's not a real ocean.{01}A true ocean is{03}totally open.{02}{00}
#1F8B What? But this looks{03}just the way Kraden{03}described it!{02}{00}
#1F8C Someday, I want{03}to see a real{03}ocean, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#1F8D Tolbi's always really{03}bustling during Colosso.{01}This festival only happens{03}once a year, so I'm{03}really excited.{02}{00}
#1F8E Colosso is held in the{03}colosseum in the heart{03}of Tolbi.{01}If we don't go right now,{03}we won't get good seats!{03}That won't be any fun!{02}{00}
#1F8F Tryouts started at the{03}colosseum today.{01}I'm planning to go{03}watch the finals.{02}{00}
#1F90 Colosso should have{03}started today. What{03}on earth is going on?{01}I saw Babi's bodyguards{03}wandering around.{01}What if something's{03}happened to our leader?{02}{00}
#1F91 Babi was already pretty{03}old back about the time{03}I was born.{01}I'm 65 years old now,{03}so just imagine how old{03}Babi must be!{02}{00}
#1F92 Can someone live to be{03}more than 100 years old?{1E}{00}
#1F93 Hmmm. Still, I'm pretty{03}sure Babi is a lot{03}older than 100...{02}{00}
#1F94 You could be right. But{03}then, what about Tolbi's{03}ruler, Babi?{01}He's supposedly at least{03}50 years older than I am!{02}{00}
#1F95 Whee! It's a festival!{03}It's the Colosso Festival!{01}What'll I buy with all{03}the money Mama gave{03}me? I can't decide!{02}{00}
#1F96 Waah! She said that money{03}was for both of us!{02}{00}
#1F97 Get your Colosso{03}souvenirs! They make{03}great gifts!{02}{00}
#1F98 Get your snacks and{03}drinks before you get{03}in the colosseum!{02}{00}
#1F99 I've decided not to fight{03}at Colosso after all.{01}Have you seen the{03}contestants? They're{03}HUGE!{02}{00}
#1F9A Wow, Tolbi's festival is{03}humongous! Just seeing all{03}this is so exciting!{02}{00}
#1F9B Rats! We overslept, and{03}now the colosseum is{03}full!{01}There's nothing we can{03}do, so we've just been{03}wandering around Tolbi.{02}{00}
#1F9C Yeah. That dice game{03}looks kinda fun.{01}If you can enjoy playing{03}a game AND win prizes,{03}why not give it a try?{02}{00}
#1F9D Children really do love{03}souvenirs, don't they?{1E}{00}
#1F9E I'll bet you like them, too.{03}Don't try to hide it! I{03}used to love souvenirs...{01}But the wife doesn't{03}go in for that sort{03}of thing.{02}{00}
#1F9F Hmph! You're only saying{03}that because your parents{03}never bought you any!{02}{00}
#1FA0 Be patient, little guy.{02}{00}
#1FA1 I'll buy you better{03}sweets than those{03}later on.{02}{00}
#1FA2 {09}{04}Waah!{07} Buy me some{03}sweets! I said buy me{03}some sweets!{02}{00}
#1FA3 The inns are all full, so{03}I'm staying here.{01}This archway keeps the{03}rain off of me, so{03}it's as good as any inn.{02}{00}
#1FA4 Tourists aren't the{03}only ones who love{03}Colosso! It's the best!{02}{00}
#1FA5 The trials are starting at{03}the colosseum today.{01}If you win there, you{03}advance to the finals.{02}{00}
#1FA6 The trials are okay, but{03}the finals are the real{03}fun at Colosso.{02}{00}
#1FA7 It's not like there have{03}been any problems{03}lately...{01}I wonder what's{03}happened to set Babi's{03}soldiers in motion.{02}{00}
#1FA8 Every year, I get older{03}and older, while Babi{03}just stays the same.{02}{00}
#1FA9 What if Babi is actually{03}a totally different{03}person now,{01}and we just don't{03}know it?{02}{00}
#1FAA I'm the oldest, so I{03}shouldn't have to{03}share my allowance.{02}{00}
#1FAB Mama told us to share{03}the money. Doesn't{03}my brother remember?{02}{00}
#1FAC We have to sell all of{03}these Colosso souvenirs{03}before Colosso ends.{02}{00}
#1FAD They're selling these at{03}the colosseum, too, but{03}they're cheaper here!{02}{00}
#1FAE I saw the people who are{03}going to fight. They look{03}so intimidating!{02}{00}
#1FAF Tolbi is not like Xian.{03}It is very lively here!{02}{00}
#1FB0 I can't say anything,{03}'cause it sounds bad,{01}but I suddenly got too{03}scared to watch Colosso,{03}so I overslept on purpose!{02}{00}
#1FB1 I like playing Lucky Dice,{03}but if I'm not careful,{03}I'll spend all my money!{02}{00}
#1FB2 The stuff they're selling{03}at the stalls along the{03}street looks so tasty!{01}If my kids buy some, I'd{03}be able to eat too.{02}{00}
#1FB3 Why do kids want such{03}awful stuff?{01}I'm not ever buying you{03}that! No matter what!{02}{00}
#1FB4 Those sweets smell great.{03}I'm not moving until{03}you buy me some.{02}{00}
#1FB5 I've been guarding our{03}spot, but it's not{03}really worth it.{01}I wonder if my friends{03}will get here soon...{02}{00}
#1FB6 Hey, have you seen anyone{03}who looks like this?{1E}{00}
#1FB7 Babi must be nearby!!!{02}{00}
#1FB8 Where's Babi!? He{03}doesn't seem to be here.{03}Let's look over there.{02}{00}
#1FB9 Missing Person{00}
#1FBA Tolbi is packed with{03}tourists during Colosso,{03}so the inns are all full.{01}Me, I just line up some{03}beds, and presto!{03}I'm an innkeeper!{02}{00}
#1FBB Do you want to{03}stay with us?{1E}{00}
#1FBC Actually, I'm sorry, but{03}we're already full, and I{03}don't have room for you.{02}{00}
#1FBD That's good... Our place{03}is already full, anyway.{02}{00}
#1FBE I couldn't sleep at all last{03}night. The guy next to me{03}snored the whole time!{01}I'm so tired... I'm just{03}not ready for Colosso!{02}{00}
#1FBF The crowds at the{03}colosseum made me feel{03}sick, so I came back!{02}{00}
#1FC0 Once Colosso starts,{03}we're going to make so{03}much money. I love this.{02}{00}
#1FC1 It's too late to start{03}looking now. They'll never{03}find a place to stay!{01}People fighting at Colosso{03}all stay at Babi's Palace.{02}{00}
#1FC2 If I could have slept last{03}night, I would have had a{03}great time at Colosso.{02}{00}
#1FC3 Huh-uh. Crowds are a{03}definite no-no.{01}Say, why wasn't Tolbi's{03}ruler{18}Babi, or whatever{03}his name is{18}there?{02}{00}
#1FC4 We paid good money to{03}rent this house during the{03}festival, so get out!{02}{00}
#1FC5 We get to stay here until{03}the owners come back.{02}{00}
#1FC6 I really want to see{03}Colosso, too!{01}But the colosseum gets{03}too crowded, so I'm just{03}going to watch the finals.{02}{00}
#1FC7 Wahhh! I want to see{03}Colosso, but no one{03}will take me!{02}{00}
#1FC8 I was stubborn; I said,{03}"I'm not going to see{03}any of the tryouts!"{01}But now, I wish I'd gone.{02}{00}
#1FC9 I keep on crying, but{03}Daddy still won't take{03}me to Colosso!{02}{00}
#1FCA I wonder if they really{03}can't find Babi...{01}If it is true, what{03}will happen to{03}Colosso?{02}{00}
#1FCB Babi wasn't at Colosso{03}according to all{03}the spectators...{02}{00}
#1FCC It's strange that Babi's{03}soldiers are hanging out{03}all around town.{01}Those bodyguards we saw{03}were probably looking{03}for Babi, right?{02}{00}
#1FCD It's strange... Babi loves{03}Colosso, but he's not{03}at the colosseum...{01}I wonder if what that{03}boy said is true. Could{03}Babi be missing?{02}{00}
#1FCE We're going to make some{03}money at Colosso.{01}But of course, Babi{03}always makes the most.{02}{00}
#1FCF I heard Babi is using the{03}money he made to build{03}a lighthouse in Gondowan.{01}Everyone calls it{03}Babi Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#1FD0 He just takes a cut of{03}all the money we earn.{03}That's how to make money!{02}{00}
#1FD1 Naming the lighthouse he{03}built after himself is{03}a little vain, you think?{02}{00}
#1FD2 You look strong...{03}Go fight at Colosso!{02}{00}
#1FD3 Hang on! Now that I think{03}about it, the tryouts{03}have already started!{01}So, even if I wanted to{03}fight in Colosso, it's{03}too late to sign up?{02}{00}
#1FD4 I guess I never would{03}have made it to the{03}finals anyway.{02}{00}
#1FD5 Is this your first{03}time to Tolbi?{1E}{00}
#1FD6 Tolbi offers many chances{03}to powerful warriors.{01}Colosso, especially, offers{03}them a great chance.{02}{00}
#1FD7 Tolbi is a fun place,{03}no matter how many{03}times you visit!{01}You ought to go and{03}enjoy yourself at Colosso.{02}{00}
#1FD8 They have some nice{03}things for sale in Tolbi,{03}so go shopping!{02}{00}
#1FD9 If you can make a name{03}for yourself at{03}Colosso, you might get{01}to become one of{03}Babi's guards.{02}{00}
#1FDA Babi chooses Colosso's{03}victors to be his soldiers{03}because of their prowess.{02}{00}
#1FDB We're fully booked with{03}reservations during{03}Colosso.{01}You're going to have a{03}hard time finding a place{03}to stay now.{02}{00}
#1FDC Colosso is the busiest{03}time of year in Tolbi.{01}In fact, you should make{03}reservations now for{03}next year's Colosso.{02}{00}
#1FDD We're so busy running{03}the inn we can't go to{03}Colosso. It's so boring.{02}{00}
#1FDE A tour group came from{03}Kalay this year.{01}They only reserved two{03}rooms, but they have so{03}many people in them...{02}{00}
#1FDF We aren't going to get{03}to see any of Colosso{03}this year.{01}We have to start cooking{03}our guests' dinners first{03}thing in the morning.{02}{00}
#1FE0 I'm not very interested{03}in Colosso. It's so{03}barbaric.{02}{00}
#1FE1 Oh, no! We barely made it{03}to Tolbi, and now we can't{03}even enter Colosso.{01}Why did we even bother{03}coming out to Tolbi!?{02}{00}
#1FE2 If we'd gotten here just{03}a little earlier, we could{03}have entered Colosso.{02}{00}
#1FE3 The tour group is feeling{03}cramped in their quarters.{01}Maybe we should build a{03}bigger inn for next{03}year.{02}{00}
#1FE4 We can't handle too{03}many more guests than{03}this.{02}{00}
#1FE5 I'm going to go to{03}the Colosso finals,{03}no matter what!{02}{00}
#1FE6 There aren't enough beds{03}for the tour group from{03}Kalay.{01}Where will they sleep?{02}{00}
#1FE7 The innkeeper told me to{03}cook a gourmet meal, but{03}he's asking the impossible.{01}Just making enough food{03}for so many guests is a{03}big job unto itself.{02}{00}
#1FE8 I have a headache just{03}thinking about how busy{03}these guests will make me.{02}{00}
#1FE9 Even though I can't enter{03}Colosso, I stayed at the{03}inn thinking I'll go watch.{01}I've come all this way,{03}so I may as well see{03}what I can.{02}{00}
#1FEA If we could have entered{03}Colosso, victory would{03}have been ours. Sheesh!{02}{00}
#1FEB What a waste to be stuck{03}here when such a big{03}festival's going on.{02}{00}
#1FEC I wonder how the tryouts{03}are going... Hmmm,{03}it's really on my mind.{02}{00}
#1FED Normally, no one's allowed{03}into Babi's Palace, but{03}during Colosso,{01}visitors are free{03}to enter.{02}{00}
#1FEE Some of the rooms in the{03}palace are available{03}to Colosso entrants.{01}You should be thankful{03}Lord Babi is such a{03}gracious host.{02}{00}
#1FEF Should the palace really{03}be open to the public{03}in such circumstances?{02}{00}
#1FF0 I wonder how many people{03}will stay here at Babi{03}Palace after Colosso...{02}{00}
#1FF1 Did you run into any of{03}Babi's soldiers in Town?{1E}{00}
#1FF2 That means they must not{03}have found him yet...{02}{00}
#1FF3 Hmph! I told them to{03}search every nook and{03}cranny of this town...{02}{00}
#1FF4 If you're entering Colosso,{03}hurry along to the{03}colosseum.{01}But even if you leave{03}now, you may be too{03}late for the trials...{02}{00}
#1FF5 I wonder how diligently{03}Babi's soldiers are{03}looking for him.{02}{00}
#1FF6 Warriors are not allowed{03}to stay in the palace if{03}they don't enter Colosso!{02}{00}
#1FF7 We have just enough{03}extra beds in this{03}room for everybody.{01}Please follow me.{02}{00}
#1FF8 You may use these four{03}beds.{01}Will you be going right{03}to sleep?{1E}{00}
#1FF9 Then, enjoy your rest.{02}{00}
#1FFA Well, if you do get tired,{03}feel free to sleep here{03}anytime you like.{02}{00}
#1FFB Would you like{03}to sleep now?{1E}{00}
#1FFC Ohh, I'm so tired...{02}{00}
#1FFD I didn't think we'd ever{03}find a place to stay. What{03}a relief!{02}{00}
#1FFE Let's rest up{03}for tomorrow.{02}{00}
#1FFF Good night.{02}{00}
#2000 G'night.{02}{00}
#2001 Sleep well.{02}{00}
#2002 Morning.{02}{00}
#2003 Good morning.{02}{00}
#2004 Good morning.{02}{00}
#2005 All right, {11}{01}! We've{03}got another hard day{03}of work ahead of us!{02}{00}
#2006 Are you planning to{03}enter Colosso?{1E}{00}
#2007 You'd better leave{03}right away, then!{01}The trials are already{03}underway. Go on to{03}the colosseum!{02}{00}
#2008 So, did you guys get{03}injured, too?{01}Getting injured just{03}before the trials begin{03}is the worst.{02}{00}
#2009 I can't fight because{03}of a little indigestion?{03}That's pathetic!{02}{00}
#200A Maybe I can shrug off{03}this pain in my gut...{03}I have to enter Colosso...{02}{00}
#200B It's no use! My stomach{03}really hurts!{02}{00}
#200C I want to watch the{03}Colosso matches, too.{01}But my job is just to{03}encourage the warriors{03}to do their best.{02}{00}
#200D I get so angry seeing{03}all the warriors going{03}off to fight in Colosso.{01}I hurt my back during{03}my training, and now I{03}can't move at all.{02}{00}
#200E Maybe I shouldn't have{03}eaten quite so much{03}yesterday...{02}{00}
#200F Only warriors who fight{03}well in Colosso's finals{03}can become soldiers here.{01}All the warriors enter{03}Colosso because they{03}want to join our ranks.{02}{00}
#2010 Lord Babi is building the{03}lighthouse as a display{03}of his power.{02}{00}
#2011 Babi's name is riding on{03}the construction of his{03}lighthouse. It's a huge{01}undertaking, which is why{03}the guard around the{03}lighthouse is so tight.{02}{00}
#2012 Even if Lord Babi doesn't{03}return, the campaign to{03}build Babi Lighthouse{01}will go on... I won't be{03}able to relax until we{03}know where Babi is.{02}{00}
#2013 My first Colosso was{03}so exciting!{01}I bet the battles will get{03}pretty heated this year.{02}{00}
#2014 Once the lighthouse is{03}complete, Babi's name{03}will live forever.{02}{00}
#2015 We'd never get near the{03}lighthouse without these{03}passes from Iodem.{02}{00}
#2016 I hear that girl is going{03}on the next campaign.{03}What could it mean?{02}{00}
#2017 Originally, there were{03}ancient ruins at the site{03}of Babi Lighthouse.{01}There's said to be an{03}extremely long tunnel{03}beneath those ruins.{02}{00}
#2018 No matter how many times{03}I run the experiment,{03}I never get the results{01}I want! My Alchemy skills{03}have weakened, as Kraden{03}warned me they would.{02}{00}
#2019 It is said that long ago,{03}the power of Alchemy{03}was sealed away.{01}But why would it have{03}been sealed away?{02}{00}
#201A Originally, the ancient{03}Venus Ruins lay buried{03}under Babi Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#201B Babi makes his scholars{03}perform all sorts of{03}research.{01}I wonder where Babi's{03}favorite scholar, Kraden,{03}is now?{02}{00}
#201C No one has ever reached{03}the end of the tunnel in{03}the ancient ruins...{01}I'd sure like to know{03}what's at the end of{03}that tunnel.{02}{00}
#201D Still, my experiments in{03}Alchemy are progressing{03}better than before.{01}Maybe Kraden's research{03}is meeting with success...{02}{00}
#201E Kraden's journey was{03}meant to revive the lost{03}art of Alchemy.{01}We hope, of course, that{03}he can explain why it had{03}been sealed away, too.{02}{00}
#201F The Venus Ruins are the{03}remnants of a magnificent{03}ancient civilization.{01}The lighthouse is being{03}built on the foundation{03}of the Venus Ruins.{02}{00}
#2020 Lord Babi expected{03}great results from{03}Kraden's journey.{01}I wonder what he{03}expected Kraden to learn{03}from that research.{02}{00}
#2021 Iodem, Iodem!{02}{00}
#2022 We went to Altmiller{03}Cave, as you commanded.{02}{00}
#2023 And what have you?{03}What news is there{03}of Babi?{02}{00}
#2024 {05}This is futile...{02}{00}
#2025 Iodem, why did you send{03}us to look for Babi in a{03}place like that?{02}{00}
#2026 Why would Lord Babi{03}enter such a dangerous{03}cave alone? It's...{02}{00}
#2027 Inconceivable?{03}Is that what you were{03}going to say?{02}{00}
#2028 Altmiller Cave is an{03}evil place.{02}{00}
#2029 If Babi went there alone,{03}a monster might have...{02}{00}
#202A I'm aware of Altmiller{03}Cave's.{05}.{05}.{05}eccentricities.{02}{00}
#202B You knew? Then why{03}would you send us{03}in there, Iodem?{02}{00}
#202C Lord Babi has left in{03}secret before...{02}{00}
#202D You mean, this isn't the{03}first time Lord Babi has{03}disappeared, Iodem?{02}{00}
#202E Do you know where{03}he went before?{02}{00}
#202F I followed Lord{03}Babi once...{02}{00}
#2030 I was certain he had{03}gone into Altmiller{03}Cave...{02}{00}
#2031 Did you ever investigate{03}the cave, Iodem?{02}{00}
#2032 What was he doing{03}in the cave?{02}{00}
#2033 Once he entered the cave,{03}Lord Babi vanished{05}{03}before my very eyes.{02}{00}
#2034 Vanished?{02}{00}
#2035 You mean you lost sight{03}of Lord Babi. Is that it?{02}{00}
#2036 After he entered the{03}mouth of the cave,{03}I followed him...{01}but he had vanished,{03}leaving no trace.{02}{00}
#2037 I tried following him{03}several times after that.{01}Each time, he vanished{03}within seconds of entering{03}the cave's mouth.{02}{00}
#2038 And you think that's{03}where Lord Babi went{03}this morning, Iodem?{02}{00}
#2039 But if he always{03}returned from Altmiller{03}Cave before...{02}{00}
#203A Then he should be{03}back soon, right?{02}{00}
#203B No. This time is{03}different. Something{03}puzzles me...{02}{00}
#203C What do you mean?{02}{00}
#203D It is certainly strange{03}that Lord Babi should go{03}right before Colosso.{01}But there's something{03}else...{02}{00}
#203E What is it?{02}{00}
#203F Lord Babi's bedding was{03}not disturbed this{03}morning.{02}{00}
#2040 What's unusual{03}about that?{02}{00}
#2041 Last night, Lord Babi did{03}not use his bed.{03}That is the problem.{02}{00}
#2042 Lord Babi has, in fact,{03}been missing since{03}last night.{02}{00}
#2043 And that is why I am{03}so worried. He has{03}never done this before.{02}{00}
#2044 We didn't know he'd been{03}missing so long...{02}{00}
#2045 You don't think Lord{03}Babi's been ki{18}{02}{00}
#2046 Speak no such foolishness!{03}I am sure Lord Babi is{03}alive and well somewhere!{02}{00}
#2047 Ah, yes, of course.{02}{00}
#2048 I will go to the colosseum{03}in Lord Babi's stead.{03}You must find him...{02}{00}
#2049 We will all conduct{03}another round of{03}searches.{02}{00}
#204A Lord Babi, where{03}have you gone?{02}{00}
#204B It looks like Lord Babi{03}didn't use his bed{03}this morning.{01}What does it mean?{02}{00}
#204C I guess Lord Babi did{03}not go to sleep{03}last night.{02}{00}
#204D {11}{07} has been staying{03}as Lord Babi's guest{03}for some time.{01}She comes from the{03}town of Lalivero, on the{03}Gondowan continent.{02}{00}
#204E {11}{07} was revered{03}as a child of the gods{03}in her hometown...{01}But she looks like an{03}average child to me.{02}{00}
#204F Babi is holding me hostage{03}in order to complete his{03}lighthouse in Lalivero.{01}When shall I ever be{03}able to return to my{03}homeland?{02}{00}
#2050 {11}{07} was taken hostage{03}to force the Laliverans{03}to build Babi Lighthouse.{01}It is heartbreaking to see{03}her tears and hear her{03}pleas to be released.{02}{00}
#2051 {11}{07} is not permitted{03}to leave this room. Child{03}of the gods or not,{01}I do not think she{03}could make it to{03}Gondowan alone.{02}{00}
#2052 Even if I escaped Babi{03}Palace, my power could{03}not get me to Lalivero.{01}It would be impossible{03}for me to make it through{03}the deadly Suhalla alone.{02}{00}
#2053 Did you just...{02}{00}
#2054 No, it is nothing.{02}{00}
#2055 They're holding the{03}preliminary Colosso{03}heats right now.{01}The winners of the{03}trials will advance{03}to the finals.{02}{00}
#2056 Sigh... The colosseum is{03}packed with people. I'll{03}never get in there.{02}{00}
#2057 Are you hoping to get{03}in to see Colosso now?{1E}{00}
#2058 First-timers all make{03}that mistake.{01}If you want to see{03}Colosso, you have to get{03}to the colosseum early.{02}{00}
#2059 Good choice... If you want{03}in, you should come back{03}early tomorrow morning.{02}{00}
#205A If you hit it big in the{03}Lucky Guess, you can win{03}a pretty penny.{01}You have to watch the{03}trials closely to decide{03}who you'll root for.{02}{00}
#205B I've been betting on the{03}Lucky Guess for many{03}years, but I've never won.{01}I'd like to hit it big{03}just once in my life.{02}{00}
#205C Colosso's Lucky Guess{03}makes the battles in{03}the colosseum better.{02}{00}
#205D I want to win big, so I{03}put it all on a warrior{03}no one else has picked.{02}{00}
#205E Do you know what the{03}Lucky Guess is?{1E}{00}
#205F Entrants can't pick their{03}own team members.{01}That way, the matches{03}won't be fixed.{02}{00}
#2060 It's a game where you try{03}to guess which warrior{03}will win the finals.{01}If you hit it right,{03}you can win fabulous{03}prizes.{02}{00}
#2061 I wonder which warrior{03}will be the one to{03}advance to the finals?{01}Oh, I can't wait!{02}{00}
#2062 Having to arrive so early{03}just to get into the{03}colosseum is awful.{02}{00}
#2063 There are so many people{03}who arrive late and{03}can't get in.{01}I suppose everyone{03}will come here early{03}tomorrow.{02}{00}
#2064 I'm going to pick the{03}biggest, strongest{03}warrior to win.{02}{00}
#2065 I'm feeling confident{03}this time. I'm sure I'll{03}get it!{02}{00}
#2066 Everyone keeps risking{03}more and more, so the{03}prize is huge!{01}If a warrior that few{03}people picked wins,{03}they'll win big!{02}{00}
#2067 Every year, I go after a{03}big win, knowing that{03}it's a mistake.{01}This is the one vice{03}I can't give up.{02}{00}
#2068 Once the trials are over,{03}it's going to get busy,{03}just like every year.{02}{00}
#2069 Go for it! That's it!{03}I'm cheering for you,{03}little guy!{02}{00}
#206A Watching the trials makes{03}me really excited. The{03}battles are incredible!{02}{00}
#206B Watching such proud,{03}skilled warriors in{03}battle is so enchanting.{02}{00}
#206C I've waited a whole year{03}to see Colosso. I can't{03}wait for the finals!{02}{00}
#206D !!!{02}{00}
#206E You have to make it{03}through countless matches{03}to reach the finals.{01}That warrior failed{03}his trial, so he's{03}disqualified here.{02}{00}
#206F You have to perfect{03}techniques like those{03}to reach the finals.{01}That warrior cleared{03}this trial, but I doubt{03}he'll make the finals.{02}{00}
#2070 Even the smaller warriors{03}can win if they have{03}enough spirit!{02}{00}
#2071 These trials are based{03}on personal challenges.{03}I get excited watching.{02}{00}
#2072 What fantastic physiques!{03}Why, if I were{03}younger...{02}{00}
#2073 I didn't think the battles{03}in the trials would be{03}so fierce...{01}I can't even imagine{03}what kind of battles{03}the finals will have!{02}{00}
#2074 No matter how good a{03}warrior is, there's always{03}someone who's better.{02}{00}
#2075 {11}{01} checked the sign.{01}Inn Full{03}No Vacancies{02}{00}
#2076 This is stage {16}{03}of the first finals{03}match.{02}{00}
#2077 This is stage {16}{03}of the first finals{03}match.{02}{00}
#2078 This is stage {16}{03}of the second finals{03}match.{02}{00}
#2079 This is stage {16}{03}of the second finals{03}match.{02}{00}
#207A This is stage {16}{03}of the third finals{03}match.{02}{00}
#207B This is stage {16}{03}of the third finals{03}match.{02}{00}
#207C Would you like to hear{03}a description of this{03}stage?{1E}{00}
#207D Would you like a friend{03}to cheer for you here?{1E}{00}
#207E If you know who you want{03}to cheer you on,{03}please let me know!{02}{00}
#207F {12}{01} will cheer{03}for you? This way,{03}please.{02}{00}
#2080 Descriptions{00}
#2081 Cheer{00}
#2082 Nothing{00}
#2083 All right, do your best!{02}{00}
#2084 Unfortunately, we have a{03}full house. Please cheer{03}somewhere else.{02}{00}
#2085 The match is about to{03}begin. Please take your{03}places.{02}{00}
#2086 Huh? Are you done{03}cheering?{1E}{00}
#2087 Then please wait here{03}until the match begins.{02}{00}
#2088 Then cheer as best{03}you can!{02}{00}
#2089 Yeah{00}
#208A Nope{00}
#208B The objective in this{03}stage is to clear a path{03}as quickly as you can.{02}{00}
#208C They call this the{03}Rock Challenge.{02}{00}
#208D Warriors must create{03}steps they can use{03}to get through here.{02}{00}
#208E Warriors must use only{03}the objects in this stage,{03}along with their own{01}strength and wit, to{03}reach the next stage.{02}{00}
#208F The objective here is to{03}make good use of the{03}scales.{02}{00}
#2090 This area is called the{03}Pipeworks.{02}{00}
#2091 See the water pipes?{03}They actually form a{03}kind of scale.{02}{00}
#2092 When one side lowers,{03}the other side rises.{02}{00}
#2093 Using this premise, you{03}must find a way to{03}reach the next stage.{02}{00}
#2094 The operator of the{03}bridge will also cheer{03}for you in this stage.{02}{00}
#2095 They call this the{03}Broken Bridge.{02}{00}
#2096 Carefully time your{03}bridge crossings to{03}reach the next stage.{02}{00}
#2097 If your timing is off,{03}you'll fall down, which{03}will cost you time.{02}{00}
#2098 The logs are the key{03}to clearing this stage.{02}{00}
#2099 This place is normally{03}called the Lumber{03}Water Crossing Area.{02}{00}
#209A The obstacle at this stage{03}is that large water tank.{02}{00}
#209B If you can get all the{03}way across in one go,{03}you don't have to{01}give it that much{03}thought.{02}{00}
#209C But if you want to reach{03}the treasure box, it'll{03}take a little planning.{02}{00}
#209D The main thing with this{03}stage is to proceed{03}through the maze...{01}without panicking{03}or getting lost.{02}{00}
#209E This stage is dubbed{03}the Mini-Maze.{02}{00}
#209F The rules are simple:{03}get through the maze{03}as quickly as you can.{02}{00}
#20A0 But you'll have to think{03}on your feet and act{03}quickly to win.{02}{00}
#20A1 The operator of the{03}lifts will cheer for{03}you here.{02}{00}
#20A2 This is the shifting{03}floor stage.{02}{00}
#20A3 Step skillfully across{03}the floor as it moves{03}around.{02}{00}
#20A4 If you don't time your{03}steps right, you'll lose{03}valuable time.{02}{00}
#20A5 Here, your objective is{03}to ride the logs as{03}quickly as possible.{02}{00}
#20A6 This is the Log-{03}Rolling Stage.{02}{00}
#20A7 Ride the logs across{03}the water to get to{03}the other side.{02}{00}
#20A8 Try to reach the opposite{03}shore and head for the{03}next stage.{02}{00}
#20A9 Scaling the wall quickly{03}is priority one in{03}this stage.{02}{00}
#20AA The fans just call this{03}The Wall.{02}{00}
#20AB Scale the wall first,{03}then get your nerve{03}up and jump!{02}{00}
#20AC Look for spots where you{03}can drop off the{03}wall quickly.{02}{00}
#20AD Your focus here will be{03}rolling the logs to{03}form a path.{02}{00}
#20AE This place is called{03}the Board Walk.{02}{00}
#20AF The logs here are{03}positioned to{03}block your path.{02}{00}
#20B0 Roll those logs to open{03}a path and follow{03}it to the next stage.{02}{00}
#20B1 Here your objective is to{03}get across the gaps{03}as quickly as you can.{02}{00}
#20B2 This stage is called{03}the Scales of{03}Justice.{02}{00}
#20B3 There are two ledges{03}that actually form{03}a scale.{02}{00}
#20B4 When one ledge rises,{03}the other falls.{02}{00}
#20B5 Use the scales to{03}cross the gaps and{03}race to the next stage.{02}{00}
#20B6 Your goal in this stage{03}is simple: find the{03}shortest path.{02}{00}
#20B7 This is the Stepping-{03}Stone Stage.{02}{00}
#20B8 You can reach the next{03}stage by jumping from{03}stone to stone.{02}{00}
#20B9 Study the placement of{03}the stones, then choose{03}the shortest path.{02}{00}
#20BA The operator of the{03}walls will cheer for{03}you on this stage.{02}{00}
#20BB This place is called{03}the Wall Wedge.{02}{00}
#20BC The pistons move back and{03}forth. Avoid them to{01}reach the next stage.{02}{00}
#20BD If your timing is off,{03}a piston might knock you{03}off the ledge.{02}{00}
#20BE To clear this stage, you{03}must be able to change{03}directions while climbing.{02}{00}
#20BF This place is normally{03}called the Free-{03}Climb Area.{02}{00}
#20C0 This sheer wall has{03}a bumpy surface.{02}{00}
#20C1 Using those bumps, feel{03}your way up the wall and{03}climb to the next stage.{02}{00}
#20C2 In this stage, you must{03}try to outpace the{03}conveyor belt.{02}{00}
#20C3 This is called the Moving{03}Sidewalk Stage.{02}{00}
#20C4 The conveyor belt moves{03}opposite the direction{03}you need to go.{02}{00}
#20C5 Race against it to{03}reach the next stage.{02}{00}
#20C6 Here you must figure out{03}how the logs and stones{03}need to be moved.{02}{00}
#20C7 This is another{03}log-rolling area.{02}{00}
#20C8 The obstacle in this stage{03}is the water tank at{03}the exit.{02}{00}
#20C9 To get across the tank,{03}you'll need to roll{03}the logs.{02}{00}
#20CA You can get through{03}quickly by moving the{03}logs and stones.{02}{00}
#20CB This is the site of the{03}first finals battle.{02}{00}
#20CC So this is where warriors{03}test their mettle{03}against each other.{02}{00}
#20CD Well, no... It's actually{03}more than that.{02}{00}
#20CE What else is involved?{02}{00}
#20CF The warriors are racing{03}to get here first and{03}get the best equipment.{02}{00}
#20D0 So there's an advantage{03}to getting here first?{03}That's quite a test!{02}{00}
#20D1 That's too hard for{03}{11}{01}. We must support{03}him as well we can...{02}{00}
#20D2 Um, don't you want to{03}hear my explanation?{1E}{00}
#20D3 All right. Then let{03}me explain in detail...{02}{00}
#20D4 Ask the attendants for{03}explanations of the{03}stages.{02}{00}
#20D5 Warriors enter the finals{03}without any of their{03}own equipment.{02}{00}
#20D6 Please look over there.{02}{00}
#20D7 That is the starting{03}point of the first{03}stage of the finals.{02}{00}
#20D8 You must get through{03}several stages before{03}you reach the arena.{02}{00}
#20D9 The chests along the way{03}contain items that may{03}be useful in battle.{02}{00}
#20DA This is the battle arena.{03}After getting here,{03}the warriors do battle.{02}{00}
#20DB You can get weapons in{03}the arena, too, but one is{03}weaker than the other.{02}{00}
#20DC So you'll have the{03}advantage if you get{03}here first.{02}{00}
#20DD Also, you can use the{03}equipment you get here{03}in your next match.{02}{00}
#20DE What do you think, {11}{01}?{03}Do you understand the{03}rules for the finals?{1E}{00}
#20DF You'll notice that each{03}stage has its own{03}attendant.{02}{00}
#20E0 ...Then I will explain it{03}to you once more.{02}{00}
#20E1 ...{11}{01}, you're a{03}contestant in the finals.{03}Do not forget that.{01}I'll be right here, so{03}come see me when you're{03}done looking things over.{02}{00}
#20E2 Hey, where do we cheer{03}from?{02}{00}
#20E3 Would you like to visit{03}the stages and hear a{03}description for each one?{02}{00}
#20E4 Yes. We'll decide where{03}to cheer for {11}{01} after{03}hearing the descriptions.{02}{00}
#20E5 {11}{01}, did you get{03}a good look around?{1E}{00}
#20E6 Let's head{03}back, then.{02}{00}
#20E7 Let me know when you're{03}done looking around.{02}{00}
#20E8 Wait, shouldn't you decide{03}where the best place to{03}cheer for {11}{01} is?{01}You can cheer from up{03}close at any stage, so{03}it's a tough call.{02}{00}
#20E9 This is the site of the{03}second finals match.{02}{00}
#20EA As I explained earlier,{03}each stage has its own{03}attendant.{02}{00}
#20EB Please ask the attendants{03}directly for descriptions{03}of each stage.{02}{00}
#20EC ...{11}{01}, that first{03}match was terrific.{01}I'll be right here,{03}so tell me when you're{03}done looking around.{02}{00}
#20ED This is the site of the{03}third finals match.{02}{00}
#20EE By now, you know that{03}each stage has its{03}own attendant.{02}{00}
#20EF Ask the attendants{03}descriptions of{03}the stages.{02}{00}
#20F0 Honestly, {11}{01}, I{03}didn't think you'd{03}make it this far!{01}I'll be right here,{03}so tell me when you're{03}done looking around.{02}{00}
#20F1 {11}{01}!!!{02}{00}
#20F2 {11}{01}...{02}{00}
#20F3 {11}{01}...{02}{00}
#20F4 {11}{01}...{02}{00}
#20F5 {11}{01}...{02}{00}
#20F6 {11}{01}...{02}{00}
#20F7 {11}{01}...{02}{00}
#20F8 Huh?{05} {11}{01}'s the{03}only one entering{03}the finals?{02}{00}
#20F9 The warriors entered{03}in the finals must go{03}in alone.{02}{00}
#20FA But why {11}{01}?{02}{00}
#20FB That is what Babi{03}wanted...{02}{00}
#20FC But I wanted to{03}enter, too!{02}{00}
#20FD We aren't accepting{03}any more entries.{02}{00}
#20FE Well, Master {11}{01},{03}please prepare yourself.{02}{00}
#20FF I guess all you can do.{05}.{05}.{05}{03}is get it over with,{03}{11}{01}.{02}{00}
#2100 I know you want to enter,{03}too, {11}{02}, but there's{03}nothing we can do.{02}{00}
#2101 This is crazy! {11}{01}{03}won't survive against{03}those Colosso warriors!{02}{00}
#2102 If {11}{01} wants to win,{03}he'll have to use{03}Psynergy.{02}{00}
#2103 Well, Babi does seem very{03}interested in his{03}Psynergy...{02}{00}
#2104 Even so, how's he{03}supposed to use{03}it here?{02}{00}
#2105 What did Babi say we're{03}supposed to do while{03}{11}{01} is competing?{02}{00}
#2106 We've made a slight{03}exception. You can cheer{03}him on from the stage.{02}{00}
#2107 You'll be able to see{03}from right up close.{02}{00}
#2108 This is the first time it{03}has ever been permitted!{03}You should thank Babi{01}for the chance to sit{03}in these special seats.{02}{00}
#2109 If everything is settled,{03}I shall take you there.{02}{00}
#210A Umm{05}, can't {11}{01} go{03}to see the finals{03}stages, too?{02}{00}
#210B I bet you want to learn{03}as much as you can about{03}the finals, eh, {11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#210C Of course, we won't{03}argue if you don't, but{03}if you can, you should.{02}{00}
#210D Come on, you can make{03}another exception,{03}can't you?{02}{00}
#210E ...I don't see the{03}harm in it.{02}{00}
#210F I can't believe {11}{01}{03}is entering midway{03}through Colosso!{02}{00}
#2110 This is a first!{03}Totally unheard of!{03}...Like I said earlier.{02}{00}
#2111 Are we ready? I'll{03}give you a tour of{03}the arena. Let's go.{02}{00}
#2112 Prepare yourselves,{03}contestants! The finals{03}will begin shortly.{02}{00}
#2113 I am Morgan. I am the{03}highest-ranked warrior.{01}I am going to win{03}the finals! And don't{03}you forget it!{02}{00}
#2114 I'm rated as the second-{03}best, but I'll prove them{03}wrong. The name's Azart.{01}Don't tell me YOU'RE the{03}one Babi handpicked to{03}be in the finals!?{02}{00}
#2115 I'm not going to lose{03}to someone who didn't{03}even clear the trials.{02}{00}
#2116 {09}{04}Waah!{07} Don't frighten me!{02}{00}
#2117 I'm incredibly nervous.{03}Wha? Me? I... I'm Galahad,{03}the third-seeded fighter.{01}I can't wait any longer...{03}When do we start?{02}{00}
#2118 ...You who have come to{03}question me...{03}You are...{05}{11}{01}?{02}{00}
#2119 I had closed my eyes...{03}to focus my mind{03}before battle.{02}{00}
#211A My name is Satrage.{03}I'm the fourth-ranked{03}warrior.{02}{00}
#211B Dekka must win the finals.{03}Dekka.{05} Dekka...{02}{00}
#211C He won't answer, no{03}matter how much you{03}speak to him.{02}{00}
#211D He's trying to get himself{03}psyched up for the battle.{02}{00}
#211E The finals can't be{03}won that easily!{02}{00}
#211F I am Navampa of{03}Gondowan, the sixth-{03}ranked warrior.{02}{00}
#2120 You're the warrior Babi{03}selected? The one they're{03}all talking about?{02}{00}
#2121 I heard rumors that you{03}were a huge, hulking man.{03}I guess they were wrong.{02}{00}
#2122 I'm Buford, the seventh{03}seed.{02}{00}
#2123 All who cleared the{03}trials are powerful{03}warriors...{02}{00}
#2124 This is a balanced{03}match{18}anyone{03}could win today!{02}{00}
#2125 Are you ready for the{03}finals? {1E}{00}
#2126 Then please wait in{03}the eighth circle.{02}{00}
#2127 We'll be starting soon,{03}so you'd better get{03}ready fast!{02}{00}
#2128 You cannot leave until{03}the finals are over.{02}{00}
#2129 I feel we've been waiting{03}forever for the finals{03}to begin.{01}You know, I had this{03}same problem at my first{03}Colosso.{02}{00}
#212A When the gong sounds,{05}{03}the finals will begin.{02}{00}
#212B Hey, any day now! We're{03}tired of waiting! Let's{03}get this thing started!{02}{00}
#212C I agree... Let the{03}finals begin already.{02}{00}
#212D Um... Yeah. I'll show you...{03}We're here to win the{03}finals.{02}{00}
#212E Hey, what's the matter...{03}Hurry up and start!{02}{00}
#212F Line up starting with{03}the top-ranked warrior,{03}and await the signal!{02}{00}
#2130 Now then, chosen warriors.{03}Let the finals begin!{02}{00}
#2131 Curses!{03}Let's do it again!{02}{00}
#2132 So, you're all set,{03}right?{02}{00}
#2133 All right! Let the{03}games begin!{02}{00}
#2134 I see you've made it{03}through your first{03}match.{02}{00}
#2135 Winning your first match{03}after jumping right into{03}the finals is awesome!{02}{00}
#2136 I should have expected{03}as much from a warrior{03}selected by Babi.{02}{00}
#2137 Now, we can go have a{03}look at the next series{03}of stages...{02}{00}
#2138 You've managed to win{03}both of your matches.{02}{00}
#2139 You're incredible, {11}{01}!{03}If you win the next one,{03}you'll be the champion!{02}{00}
#213A A fantastic performance,{03}just as Babi expected...{01}I won't underestimate{03}you again!{02}{00}
#213B Let me take you to the{03}next group of stages.{02}{00}
#213C This year's finals are{03}incredible. This atmosphere{03}can't be beat!{02}{00}
#213D Moving such a huge rock{03}must be a real{03}workout.{02}{00}
#213E There's only one final, and{03}this is it. We're so{03}lucky to be here for it!{02}{00}
#213F Did you see his moves{03}out there on that{03}rickety bridge?{02}{00}
#2140 How many warriors have{03}swallowed their pain to{03}get this chest?{02}{00}
#2141 I can't believe{03}anybody ever gets{03}lost in that maze...{02}{00}
#2142 How do they make that{03}floor move like that?{02}{00}
#2143 I'm amazed people can{03}actually cross the logs{03}without falling in!{02}{00}
#2144 Boy, that bit over there{03}must make their legs{03}feel like rubber.{02}{00}
#2145 I heard Babi got the log-{03}rolling idea from his{03}trip to Kolima Forest.{02}{00}
#2146 The street vendors' corn{03}on the cob looked sooo{03}good... Oh, I'm hungry!{02}{00}
#2147 I can't see anything{03}when I'm facing{03}backward!{01}I only took this{03}job so I could see{03}the finals!{02}{00}
#2148 It's not very exciting{03}work, but in my own{03}way, I do my best.{01}Isn't there anyone{03}to cheer for me?{02}{00}
#2149 Standing for long periods{03}of time can really{03}wear you out...{02}{00}
#214A I was up all night trying{03}to memorize these stage{03}descriptions.{01}I've got 'em down pat!{02}{00}
#214B Some tourist told me I{03}look like the guy working{03}next door... The nerve!{02}{00}
#214C {11}{01} fell asleep...{02}{00}
#214D He must be exhausted.{02}{00}
#214E Let's leave him to{03}sleep for now.{02}{00}
#214F You...{05} You can {05}see me?{02}{00}
#2150 Someone's there.{02}{00}
#2151 Wrapped in Psynergetic{03}light... Who could it be?{02}{00}
#2152 You know about Psynergy?{03}And you can see me?{02}{00}
#2153 Come on, mister!{03}Don't hide{18}show{03}yourself!{02}{00}
#2154 Even if I wanted to show{03}myself... As you can{03}see, I cannot move.{02}{00}
#2155 What do you mean,{03}"as you can see"?{03}You're invisible!{02}{00}
#2156 Oh... That's right.{02}{00}
#2157 You say you can't{03}move... What happened?{02}{00}
#2158 Hmmm, yes. I ran out of{03}my draught and collapsed{03}here.{02}{00}
#2159 Draught?{02}{00}
#215A Exactly what kind of{03}draught is it?{02}{00}
#215B You couldn't even begin{03}to comprehend if I{03}tried to tell you. {09}{04}Cough.{07}{02}{00}
#215C You seem to be in a lot{03}of pain. Your life depends{03}on that draught, huh?{02}{00}
#215D It does. Could you do{03}me a favor?{02}{00}
#215E A favor? What is it?{02}{00}
#215F I'd like you to get{03}my draught for me.{02}{00}
#2160 Get it? Where is it?{02}{00}
#2161 Deep in this cave...{02}{00}
#2162 What, is there a{03}pharmacy down there?{02}{00}
#2163 Witty, aren't we? I'll{03}have to tell you how to{03}find it.{01}Can you do this for me?{1E}{00}
#2164 Are you kidding, {11}{01}?{03}We haven't even actually{03}seen this guy!{02}{00}
#2165 He said he couldn't move{03}even if he wanted to,{03}right?{01}Someone is in trouble!{03}It's only natural to{03}want to help.{02}{00}
#2166 I agree with {11}{03}{18}{03}whoever he is, he{03}needs our help.{02}{00}
#2167 Fine! Okay! We should help{03}people in need.{03}Is that better!?{02}{00}
#2168 I'm with you, {11}{01}. I{03}don't trust anyone who's{03}afraid to show himself.{02}{00}
#2169 He said he couldn't{03}even move, didn't he?{01}Someone is in trouble!{03}It's only natural{03}to want to help.{02}{00}
#216A I agree with {11}{03}{1B}{03}line of thinking.{02}{00}
#216B Fine! Whatever! We'll{03}help everybody who needs{03}help. Is that better?{02}{00}
#216C Will you get{03}it for me?!{02}{00}
#216D What do we have to do{03}to get your draught?{02}{00}
#216E First, you'll have to go{03}deep into the cave.{02}{00}
#216F You'll find five rocks{03}sticking up out of the{03}ground.{02}{00}
#2170 Rotate the rocks on the{03}left and right sides.{02}{00}
#2171 When you turn the rocks{03}in the right order, five{03}colored lights will appear.{02}{00}
#2172 Colored lights!?{03}This sounds weird.{02}{00}
#2173 That's right. Lights will{03}appear on the wall.{02}{00}
#2174 There will be five colors:{03}blue, green, white,{03}yellow, and red.{02}{00}
#2175 Turn the five rocks in{03}accordance with those{03}colors.{02}{00}
#2176 Riiight... Spin the rocks{03}in accordance with{03}the color of the light...{02}{00}
#2177 The blue light corresponds{03}to the rock farthest{03}to the left.{01}In order, the other{03}rocks are green, white,{03}yellow, and red.{01}When you see the light,{03}rotate the corresponding{03}rock.{02}{00}
#2178 So, in order, left to{03}right, the colors are blue,{03}green, white, yellow, red?{02}{00}
#2179 Correct. If you do this{03}correctly, a hidden{03}door will open.{02}{00}
#217A A door? Somewhere deep{03}in a cave? Who put it{03}there?{02}{00}
#217B An ancient civilization,{03}long since vanished.{03}{09}{04}Ohhh!{07} Please hurry!{02}{00}
#217C He seems to be in a lot{03}of pain. We'd better find{03}that cave, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#217D Wait...{02}{00}
#217E The draught is...{03}on a table behind{03}the door.{02}{00}
#217F Did you forget the order{03}of rock colors?{1E}{00}
#2180 From the left, it's blue,{03}green, white, yellow,{03}and red.{01}Match the colors to{03}the rocks in order to{03}open the door.{02}{00}
#2181 Deep in the cave are five{03}rocks. Turn the ones on{03}the ends first.{01}When the lights appear,{03}turn the rocks that{03}correspond to the colors.{02}{00}
#2182 If they don't get{03}me that draught,{03}I{05}... I'll...{02}{00}
#2183 You... You came back...{03}Please, the draught{18}{03}quickly.{02}{00}
#2184 Oh, thank you!{03}You've saved my life.{01}{05}Squeak... {05}{09}{04}Glug glug glug...{07}{02}{00}
#2185 Thank you for your{03}help. I'll be okay now.{02}{00}
#2186 Look! It's a man!{02}{00}
#2187 What are you talking{03}about? What did you{03}expect?{02}{00}
#2188 Well, I mean, we couldn't{03}see who was talking...{02}{00}
#2189 My sudden appearance{03}seems to have{03}startled you.{1E}{00}
#218A I would have revealed{03}myself sooner, but I could{03}not even move...{02}{00}
#218B You must be well{03}traveled indeed if{03}that didn't shock you.{02}{00}
#218C How did you become{03}paralyzed while you{03}were invisible?{02}{00}
#218D And that ability to conceal{03}yourself... Are you{03}an Adept?{02}{00}
#218E An Adept? What are you{03}talking about?{02}{00}
#218F You used Psynergy to{03}conceal yourself,{03}didn't you?{01}Only an Adept could{03}do that.{02}{00}
#2190 Oh, um... Yes, I{05} was{05} using{03}Psynergy to conceal{03}myself...{02}{00}
#2191 Something in his{03}tale doesn't sound{03}right...{02}{00}
#2192 I shall peer into{03}his heart.{02}{00}
#2193 What's the matter, {11}{03}?{02}{00}
#2194 This is Babi, the ruler{03}of Tolbi!{02}{00}
#2195 And that {09}{02}wasn't{07} Psynergy{03}he was using to conceal{03}himself...{01}It was the power of an{03}ancient civilization!{02}{00}
#2196 I said nothing of the{03}kind! How can you{03}know that?{02}{00}
#2197 So, I guess that would{03}make you Adepts...{02}{00}
#2198 Does that mean...{05}{03}Have I finally{03}found true Lemurians!?{02}{00}
#2199 That's what I've been{03}saying! We're Adepts.{03}...But{05} what's Lemuria?{02}{00}
#219A Yes, what is{03}this "Lemuria"?{02}{00}
#219B What? You're Adepts...{03}but not Lemurians?{02}{00}
#219C So I was wrong...{02}{00}
#219D Are you searching for{03}these Lemurians, Babi?{02}{00}
#219E Babi, you're the ruler of{03}Tolbi... You can have{03}anything you want.{01}Why would you want{03}to find these{03}Lemurians?{02}{00}
#219F Even the ruler of Tolbi{03}has his limitations.{02}{00}
#21A0 Every year, I grow{03}older and more frail...{03}This body's had it.{02}{00}
#21A1 And you regret{03}growing older?{02}{00}
#21A2 I understand your{03}desire to remain young,{01}but there's nothing{03}anyone can do about it.{02}{00}
#21A3 Wait a sec, {11}{01}!{03}Do you remember when{03}we were in Sol Sanctum?{1E}{00}
#21A4 That's right! Kraden said{03}Alchemy could thwart{03}death itself!{02}{00}
#21A5 You forgot? Kraden said{03}Alchemy could be used to{03}thwart death.{02}{00}
#21A6 What was that?{02}{00}
#21A7 Did you say you{03}know Kraden?{1E}{00}
#21A8 Babi!{02}{00}
#21A9 We've been searching{03}everywhere for you,{03}Babi!{02}{00}
#21AA Iodem said we would{03}find you in Altmiller{03}Cave!{02}{00}
#21AB You're...not glad{03}we found you?{02}{00}
#21AC No, it's not that.{02}{00}
#21AD What are you doing in{03}a cave such as this,{03}my lord?{02}{00}
#21AE I have my reasons...{02}{00}
#21AF Everyone in Tolbi has{03}been in a panic over{03}your absence.{02}{00}
#21B0 I did not mean to{03}cause anyone any{03}undue concern.{02}{00}
#21B1 We're just happy we{03}found you before the{03}finals began.{02}{00}
#21B2 The trials have{03}already ended?{02}{00}
#21B3 Why have you been in{03}this cave for so long?{02}{00}
#21B4 I had{05}{05} an important{03}errand, but it has been{03}taken care of.{02}{00}
#21B5 Splendid! Then you can{03}attend the finals.{02}{00}
#21B6 I must speak more with{03}these people.{02}{00}
#21B7 Who are they?{02}{00}
#21B8 I{05}{05} owe my life{03}to them...{02}{00}
#21B9 Pardon our rudeness.{03}You have our gratitude{03}for saving Babi's life.{02}{00}
#21BA We must have Iodem{03}grant them a reward.{02}{00}
#21BB You can speak with them{03}again after the{03}finals are finished.{02}{00}
#21BC Oh. I see...{03}If that's what we{03}have to do, then...{02}{00}
#21BD I have not heard{03}your names yet.{02}{00}
#21BE I'm {11}{02}.{02}{00}
#21BF This is {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#21C0 I am {11}{03}.{02}{00}
#21C1 My name is {11}{04}.{02}{00}
#21C2 Come see me at my{03}palace once the finals{03}have ended.{02}{00}
#21C3 I would like to speak{03}with you further.{02}{00}
#21C4 Say, I have an idea...{03}Why don't you enter{03}the finals?{02}{00}
#21C5 You have some{03}interesting{03}powers.{02}{00}
#21C6 But, Lord Babi, they{03}have not cleared{03}the trials.{02}{00}
#21C7 Only warriors who clear{03}the trials can appear{03}in the finals.{02}{00}
#21C8 And you don't think that{03}saving my life qualifies{03}as a suitable trial?{02}{00}
#21C9 I look forward to{03}seeing you battle!{02}{00}
#21CA He's asking us to{03}appear in Colosso,{03}isn't he?{02}{00}
#21CB Is he serious?{02}{00}
#21CC He wants to see us fight{03}using our Psynergy...{03}That's what it is.{02}{00}
#21CD The finals...{03}Should we do it?{1E}{00}
#21CE So we'll do it?{02}{00}
#21CF You don't want to{03}either, do you?{02}{00}
#21D0 Either way, we're stuck{03}here in Tolbi until{03}Colosso is over.{02}{00}
#21D1 Babi said that he wanted{03}to talk to us, didn't he?{02}{00}
#21D2 He seemed to{03}know Kraden.{02}{00}
#21D3 What could be the{03}connection between{03}Lemuria and Adepts?{02}{00}
#21D4 I suspect he knows{03}quite a bit about what's{03}going on with us.{02}{00}
#21D5 I guess all we can do is{03}wait around until Colosso{03}is over...{01}I hate just waiting{03}around...{02}{00}
#21D6 Come on, let's{03}enter Colosso!{03}Can we do it?{1E}{00}
#21D7 Great! It's decided.{03}We'll just have to{03}do our best!{02}{00}
#21D8 If you want to do it,{03}{11}{01}, we'll go along{03}with you.{02}{00}
#21D9 What? Don't let me{03}down like this!{02}{00}
#21DA I guess we'll just wait{03}until we reach Tolbi and{03}let {11}{01} decide there.{02}{00}
#21DB {10} rotated{03}the rock.{02}{00}
#21DC Colosso will reach its{03}apex any minute now.{01}Let's hurry to the{03}colosseum so we can see{03}the gladiators fighting!{02}{00}
#21DD Are you planning to{03}watch the finals? They{03}may have already started!{02}{00}
#21DE My family saved me a{03}seat at the colosseum,{03}so I'm set.{01}Still, we should{03}head to Colosso soon.{02}{00}
#21DF I thought something{03}happened to Babi...{01}He made an appearance at{03}the finals, though, so I{03}guess it was nothing.{02}{00}
#21E0 The colosseum was so full{03}that I couldn't get in. I{03}only did the Lucky Guess.{02}{00}
#21E1 Nobody else has noticed,{03}but this year's festival{03}seems a little long.{02}{00}
#21E2 Hooray! It's the finals!{03}Seven warriors remain!{03}Only one final winner!{02}{00}
#21E3 Waah! My big brother{03}spent all our souvenir{03}money on Lucky Guess!{02}{00}
#21E4 How about some Colosso{03}souvenirs? This is your{03}last chance! 30% off!{02}{00}
#21E5 The finals are so long,{03}it's a good idea to buy{03}some food to take along!{02}{00}
#21E6 The trials were so{03}riveting!{01}The finals are even more{03}incredible.{03}I can't wait!{02}{00}
#21E7 I have seats to the finals.{03}They cost money. It is{03}too much.{02}{00}
#21E8 I overslept again, so I{03}can't get into the{03}colosseum!{01}Maybe I should buy{03}good seats from{03}a scalper...{02}{00}
#21E9 Oh, there are always{03}scalpers at the{03}Colosso finals!{01}I think scalpers only try{03}to cheat folks coming in{03}from the countryside.{02}{00}
#21EA The finals are about to{03}start. It's kind{03}of sad.{02}{00}
#21EB Just wait until Colosso{03}ends, like a good{03}kid.{02}{00}
#21EC The prices drop once{03}Colosso ends, so buying{03}now would be foolish!{02}{00}
#21ED They said they'd buy it{03}after Colosso ended, but{03}I wonder...{02}{00}
#21EE The finals start today.{03}I wonder if my buddy{03}is doing all right.{01}If you need a seat,{03}buy a ticket from{03}my buddy.{02}{00}
#21EF I've got to get to the{03}colosseum...{01}What'll I do if I miss{03}the height of the {03}battle!{02}{00}
#21F0 A battle to the death with{03}7 strapping warriors...{03}Oh, it's so exciting!{02}{00}
#21F1 The finals start on{03}Babi's signal.{03}I love that!{02}{00}
#21F2 So why were the soldiers{03}all distraught if nothing{03}was wrong with Babi?{02}{00}
#21F3 I could still buy seats{03}from a scalper, but I{03}hate doing that!{02}{00}
#21F4 No matter how I add it{03}up, this year's{03}festival is longer!{02}{00}
#21F5 We could win big if we{03}used our allowance to{03}enter the Lucky Guess.{02}{00}
#21F6 Mama, why did you{03}listen to my brother?{02}{00}
#21F7 We can't sell anything{03}once the finals end. We{03}have to sell it now!{02}{00}
#21F8 This is the final push!{03}Anything that isn't sold{03}will go to waste!{02}{00}
#21F9 Fighting in Colosso{03}requires a lot of power.{03}I couldn't do it.{02}{00}
#21FA They're selling finals seats{03}right at the colosseum{03}entrance. It's too much!{02}{00}
#21FB It's supposed to be free...{03}Having to buy seats from{03}scalpers is annoying.{02}{00}
#21FC There's no way poor{03}soldiers like us can{03}afford scalped tickets!{02}{00}
#21FD Once Colosso ends, our{03}lives can go back to{03}normal.{02}{00}
#21FE Festivals are so{03}expensive.  My wallet's{03}empty!{02}{00}
#21FF Mom, you said you were{03}all out of money, but{03}you're not!{02}{00}
#2200 Today is a big day for{03}us scalpers. What do you{03}say, buddy?{02}{00}
#2201 So, Colosso has already{03}reached the finals.{01}We have only a few{03}more days to make{03}some money.{02}{00}
#2202 The festival schedule was{03}delayed for some{03}reason.{01}Thanks to that, we{03}made more money than{03}usual.{02}{00}
#2203 That's strange... I wonder{03}what happened to all{03}my money.{02}{00}
#2204 I just saw Babi, the{03}town's ruler!{01}He is very energetic{03}for someone his age,{03}isn't he?{02}{00}
#2205 Are we making more{03}money now that the{03}festival is longer?{02}{00}
#2206 So they did extend the{03}festival? I didn't hear{03}anything about it.{02}{00}
#2207 I can't afford to stay{03}here.{01}I wonder when I should{03}tell the owner that I{03}don't have any money.{02}{00}
#2208 The air in the{03}colosseum is so{03}tense when Babi's there.{02}{00}
#2209 Here I am in Tolbi{03}for the finals, but{03}I'm stuck housesitting!{02}{00}
#220A If somebody else would{03}watch the house for me,{03}I could see the festival.{02}{00}
#220B I'm going to watch the{03}finals now... Please come{03}another time.{02}{00}
#220C Hooray! We're going{03}to Colosso now!{03}It's the finals!{02}{00}
#220D Colosso is already{03}at the finals!{01}Hurry! You gotta see{03}the fighting at the{03}colosseum.{02}{00}
#220E Since we didn't get to see{03}the trials, we're really{03}charged up for this!{02}{00}
#220F Babi showed himself at{03}the finals.{01}So was that whole thing{03}about him being missing{03}just a misunderstanding?{1E}{00}
#2210 Well, I guess so, since{03}he's in the colosseum{03}now.{02}{00}
#2211 Huh? Then they found him{03}in time for the finals?{01}That sounds ludicrous!{02}{00}
#2212 What's up? Babi decided{03}to show up for the{03}finals?{02}{00}
#2213 So what were Babi's{03}soldiers doing searching{03}through town?{02}{00}
#2214 Maybe watching the trials{03}is too much for Babi now{03}that he's older.{02}{00}
#2215 Babi apparently has some{03}reason for building{03}the lighthouse.{01}But we have no way of{03}knowing what sort of{03}reason that might be.{02}{00}
#2216 I heard Babi is searching{03}for something at sea!{02}{00}
#2217 Before he started the{03}lighthouse, Babi sent many{03}soldiers to sea.{01}I wonder if his reason{03}for building the lighthouse{03}is related to the sea.{02}{00}
#2218 Babi has been making{03}strange references to{03}his time approaching.{01}He sounds willing to{03}risk his life to find{03}what he's looking for.{02}{00}
#2219 So, the Colosso finals{03}are finally here!{01}Once Colosso ends, it will{03}be our chance to{03}make some money!{02}{00}
#221A The tourists all buy{03}weapons and gear when{03}they leave. It's great!{02}{00}
#221B They require a lot of{03}healing herbs once the{03}finals begin.{01}It just goes to show{03}you how harsh the final{03}battles are.{02}{00}
#221C You could say the{03}warriors in the finals{03}are supermen.{01}They get their strength{03}back faster than{03}anyone I've seen.{02}{00}
#221D Hmm... Maybe I'll close{03}the shop so I can go{03}watch the finals.{02}{00}
#221E If Mom finds out I{03}went to watch the finals,{03}she's gonna ground me!{02}{00}
#221F Once the finals begin,{03}everyone tries to{03}ditch out on work.{02}{00}
#2220 This year I'm not letting{03}anyone skip work for{03}Colosso!{01}No one's gotten{03}away so far...{02}{00}
#2221 The wife has a close{03}eye on me, so I can't{03}go see Colosso.{01}But if I don't soon,{03}the finals will start{03}without me!{02}{00}
#2222 Do you want to see{03}the finals so badly{03}you'd skip work to do it?{1E}{00}
#2223 Isn't it strange that{03}something so barbaric{03}is so much fun?{02}{00}
#2224 Hmm, I thought all men{03}loved those battles.{01}To each their own,{03}I suppose.{02}{00}
#2225 The moment I hear the{03}finals are starting, I{03}want to go watch. Weird.{02}{00}
#2226 So, Colosso is ending{03}soon... It's kind of{03}sad.{02}{00}
#2227 The Colosso finals are{03}starting soon. Shall we{03}go to the colosseum?{02}{00}
#2228 Maybe I'll do some{03}research on the finals{03}for next year's Colosso.{02}{00}
#2229 I'm the one who really{03}wants to skip work to{03}watch the finals!{02}{00}
#222A Once things settle down,{03}I'm sure these folks will{03}go to the colosseum, too.{02}{00}
#222B If the master slips out,{03}the lady will be upset.{03}That's our chance!{01}What's with the master?{03}He'd better go soon!{02}{00}
#222C We women are the only{03}ones who aren't hoping{03}to sneak out.{01}But this is no joke! We'll{03}have to do all the work{03}if they leave!{02}{00}
#222D Hasn't the master gone{03}to Colosso yet?{01}The lady must be keeping{03}tight watch this year. It's{03}hard to fool her.{02}{00}
#222E I don't have any{03}particular interest in the{03}fighting at Colosso.{01}But I am a little sad{03}the festival is going{03}to end...{02}{00}
#222F I want to see the finals,{03}but not all the praising{03}of the winner.{02}{00}
#2230 The trial battles weren't{03}quite like I imagined...{01}It's probably a good{03}idea to watch the{03}finals too.{02}{00}
#2231 If you miss the finals at{03}Tolbi's Festival,{03}you'll regret it.{01}Why don't you hurry on{03}to the colosseum for{03}the very moving finale.{02}{00}
#2232 If you're not interested{03}in the final battles, can{03}we trade spots?{02}{00}
#2233 You're {11}{01},{03}aren't you?{1E}{00}
#2234 Babi left word that{03}he would be waiting for{03}you at the colosseum.{01}Don't go to the palace.{03}Go directly to the{03}colosseum.{02}{00}
#2235 Oh, I guess I was{03}mistaken...{02}{00}
#2236 No, I'm certain it{03}was you.{02}{00}
#2237 Babi left word that{03}he would be waiting for{03}you at the colosseum.{01}Don't go to the palace.{03}Go directly to the{03}colosseum.{02}{00}
#2238 Babi wants you to go{03}straight to the{03}colosseum.{01}Don't even bother{03}going to the palace.{02}{00}
#2239 {11}{01}, I'd really{03}like to thank you for{03}saving Babi.{01}He is waiting for you{03}now at the colosseum.{02}{00}
#223A Babi is waiting for you at{03}the colosseum. He wants{03}you to go straight there.{02}{00}
#223B Sure, they saved Babi, but{03}I'm still not convinced{03}they belong in the finals.{02}{00}
#223C Babi is a deliberate{03}man{18}he wouldn't play{03}favorites like that!{01}What could these{03}warriors possibly have{03}that Babi wants?{02}{00}
#223D Babi's soldiers have{03}gone to see the sights{03}at Colosso.{01}They're warriors, too, {03}so that ought to{03}get them pumped up!{02}{00}
#223E What are you doing?{03}Hurry over to{03}the colosseum!{02}{00}
#223F Those guys look really{03}confident about fighting!{01}I wonder what would{03}happen if they fought{03}at Colosso?{02}{00}
#2240 The finals are all{03}that's left of this{03}year's Colosso...{01}I can't wait to see what{03}kind of battles there{03}will be!{02}{00}
#2241 You all came to rest up{03}before the match,{03}didn't you?{01}Would you like to sleep{03}right now?{1E}{00}
#2242 Here you are.{03}Have a nice rest!{02}{00}
#2243 If you're tired,{03}please feel free to{03}get some rest.{02}{00}
#2244 Do you want to rest?{02}{00}
#2245 Well, if you're tired,{03}please feel free to get{03}some rest.{02}{00}
#2246 I hope you'll all do{03}well in the finals!{02}{00}
#2247 Babi has returned and the{03}finals are set to begin!{02}{00}
#2248 When Babi returned, he{03}headed off to the festival{03}without even resting.{01}The finals this year{03}must have some sort of{03}significance for him.{02}{00}
#2249 What's going on? {11}{07}{03}is looking{03}much happier.{01}I wonder what happened{03}to make that girl smile.{02}{00}
#224A The soldiers came to see{03}{11}{07}. She's been in a{03}great mood ever since.{01}Those soldiers didn't{03}say anything that might{03}make me smile...{02}{00}
#224B Hmph! I wish Colosso{03}would hurry up and{03}end!{02}{00}
#224C A smile on a pretty girl{03}is much nicer than tears!{01}When I see {11}{07} in a{03}good mood, it makes me{03}feel happy too!{02}{00}
#224D {11}{07} is a good girl,{03}but she has a few quirks{03}that are all her own.{02}{00}
#224E I don't have the least{03}interest in Colosso.{01}But when it's over,{03}something really good{03}will happen.{02}{00}
#224F The finals are finally{03}here! I can't wait to see{03}how the battles turn out!{02}{00}
#2250 I heard Babi has picked{03}some warriors for this{03}year's finals himself!{01}I'm anxious to see how{03}tough those warriors{03}are!{02}{00}
#2251 The colosseum is already{03}full!{01}If you really want to{03}watch, buy a ticket{03}from those scalpers.{02}{00}
#2252 A warrior named {11}{01}{03}was selected for the{03}finals by Babi.{01}Maybe I should put a{03}little money on Babi's{03}special warrior...{02}{00}
#2253 Having a warrior who{03}wasn't in the trials{03}appear in the finals{01}is really going to{03}mess things up.{02}{00}
#2254 I want to watch the finals{03}from a good spot{05},{03}but it costs too much!{02}{00}
#2255 It was hard for me to{03}get seats too... Come on{03}make up your mind!{02}{00}
#2256 Hey, hold on a second!{02}{00}
#2257 You want seats?{1E}{00}
#2258 I've got a customer I'm{03}talking to here!{01}Catch me later.{02}{00}
#2259 Then, what? You got a{03}problem? I'm busy. I don't{03}need any distractions!{02}{00}
#225A Want to try out the{03}Lucky Guess?{1E}{00}
#225B Let me know if you want{03}to play, okay?{02}{00}
#225C Aren't you {11}{01}? The{03}one handpicked by{03}Babi?{1E}{00}
#225D You can't fool me...{03}You fit the features{03}I've heard about exactly!{01}Sorry, but warriors who{03}are actually fighting{03}can't play.{02}{00}
#225E Look, I'm sorry, but we{03}have some rules to help{03}keep things legit.{01}Warriors who made the{03}finals, and their team{03}members, can't play.{02}{00}
#225F The real battles are about{03}to begin at the colosseum!{01}The strongest warrior{03}will be determined by{03}these battles.{02}{00}
#2260 The warrior named{03}{11}{01} is sure to{03}be an incredible fighter.{01}I picked {11}{01} in the{03}Lucky Guess.{02}{00}
#2261 Of course it's the{03}rich who have the money{03}to buy seats at the finals.{01}They always get to have{03}all the fun without{03}having to work hard!{02}{00}
#2262 There can be upsets{03}in the Colosso finals,{03}you know.{01}There's no guarantee{03}the warrior chosen{03}by Babi will win.{02}{00}
#2263 What kind of warrior{03}is that {11}{01} guy{03}who Babi chose?{02}{00}
#2264 Maybe I will buy a{03}seat... I don't know{03}what to do!{02}{00}
#2265 I'm going to be in trouble{03}if I get stuck with any{03}unsold seats...{02}{00}
#2266 All of the profits from{03}the Lucky Guess go to{03}Babi.{01}If it weren't for that,{03}we'd make a killing!{02}{00}
#2267 Hey, you're {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#2268 You're kidding... That's{03}{11}{01}? The one Babi{03}picked?{02}{00}
#2269 Yeah{05}, there's no{03}mistaking it...{03}He's {11}{01}, for sure.{02}{00}
#226A He's just a kid!{03}What does Babi think{03}Colosso is? A playground?{02}{00}
#226B Putting him in the finals{03}is an insult to everyone{03}who cleared the trials!{02}{00}
#226C Don't you people{03}have faith in Babi?{02}{00}
#226D Babi wouldn't let him into{03}the finals just to repay{03}a favor!{02}{00}
#226E I guess Babi wouldn't{03}let {11}{01} in if he{03}weren't a good match.{02}{00}
#226F We've been waiting for{03}you and your friends,{03}{11}{01}.{02}{00}
#2270 All of the Colosso{03}participants go to the{03}waiting room, OK?{1E}{00}
#2271 All right, this way{03}please.{02}{00}
#2272 {11}{01}! You can't just{03}{09}{02}watch{07} the finals!{03}You're fighting in them!{02}{00}
#2273 Babi is looking forward{03}to seeing your battles.{02}{00}
#2274 He'll be angry if you just{03}watch from the sidelines.{03}Trust me on that.{02}{00}
#2275 We were told to make{03}sure you appear in the{03}finals, no matter what.{02}{00}
#2276 Really, you might as well{03}get used to the idea.{01}You're competing{03}in the finals.{02}{00}
#2277 Well, it seems we have no{03}choice{18}we have to{03}fight in the finals!{02}{00}
#2278 Would it cause problems{03}for everyone if we{03}didn't do this?{02}{00}
#2279 I don't want to be the{03}source of any trouble.{03}Let's fight.{02}{00}
#227A We're in a fix, {11}{01}.{03}We have to do it,{03}don't you think?{1E}{00}
#227B We appreciate this,{03}{11}{01}. Well, come this{03}way, please.{02}{00}
#227C Why do you have to be so{03}stubborn at a time like{03}this?{02}{00}
#227D {11}{02}, why don't you{03}pretend to be{03}our leader...{01}just until we're in the{03}participants' room?{02}{00}
#227E Yes. Maybe once we get{03}that far, {11}{01} will{03}have a better mindset.{02}{00}
#227F All right, guys!{03}Lead on!{02}{00}
#2280 {11}{01}!{01}Get up, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#2281 Are you okay? You were{03}having nightmares for{03}quite a while...{02}{00}
#2282 What's the matter,{03}{11}{01}?{02}{00}
#2283 What? You entered{03}and fought in the finals?{02}{00}
#2284 How could you? You{03}haven't even been to the{03}colosseum yet, {11}{01}!{01}You came here to get a{03}little rest before{03}the finals.{02}{00}
#2285 Sounds like you've been{03}dreaming, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#2286 You're so exhausted, it's{03}giving you nightmares. Are{03}you okay now, {11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#2287 You think you can manage?{01}I understand, but don't{03}overdo it, OK, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#2288 {11}{01}'s awake now,{03}so let's head over to{03}the colosseum.{02}{00}
#2289 Okay! We're off to{03}the colosseum!{02}{00}
#228A If you're tired,{03}please feel free{03}to rest.{02}{00}
#228B I hope you all perform{03}well in the finals.{02}{00}
#228C {11}{01}...{02}{00}
#228D Huh?{02}{00}
#228E You've awakened.{02}{00}
#228F Colosso? Duh! That ended{03}long ago!{02}{00}
#2290 You fell into a{03}deep sleep...{03}Don't you remember?{1E}{00}
#2291 Oh, gimme a break.{03}You were out cold! You{03}don't remember a thing!{02}{00}
#2292 Of course he doesn't!{03}He was out cold!{03}...You had us worried!{02}{00}
#2293 I'm sorry for shouting{03}at you.{02}{00}
#2294 You fought brilliantly{03}to the end, {11}{01}.{01}Babi was singing{03}your praises.{02}{00}
#2295 Are you okay now?{03}In body and mind?{1E}{00}
#2296 He'd better be all right,{03}after sleeping this{03}long. Sheesh!{02}{00}
#2297 If you feel out of sorts,{01}it's probably because{03}you slept too long!{03}Sheesh!{02}{00}
#2298 I'm sorry for shouting{03}again.{02}{00}
#2299 Babi said he wanted to{03}see you when you came{03}to, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#229A If you're okay,{03}shall we go see Babi?{02}{00}
#229B You're fine!{03}Aren't you, {11}{01}?{02}{00}
#229C I'm not sure {11}{01}'s{03}up to it just yet.{02}{00}
#229D What is it? Feeling weak?{03}Fresh air and a walk{03}will fix that, right?{02}{00}
#229E I'm more worried{03}about what Babi wants.{03}Let's get going!{02}{00}
#229F Are you sure you should{03}be getting up so{03}suddenly like that?{02}{00}
#22A0 He's fine.{03}He doesn't want to{03}lounge around all day!{02}{00}
#22A1 I see. Let's go see{03}Babi then.{02}{00}
#22A2 I've lost all my enthusiasm{03}since Colosso ended.{01}I can't wait until{03}next year's festival!{02}{00}
#22A3 All the warriors who{03}stayed in the palace left{03}when Colosso ended.{01}Are you folks leaving{03}too?{1E}{00}
#22A4 Oh, that's too bad. I bet{03}we could have had a{03}good time together.{02}{00}
#22A5 Huh? I thought for sure{03}you'd be going, too.{03}I guess not...{02}{00}
#22A6 The end of a festival{03}is always the loneliest{03}time of year.{02}{00}
#22A7 All the heroic warriors{03}who took part in Colosso{03}should remain in Tolbi.{01}Finding warriors like{03}that is why Babi holds{03}Colosso in the first place!{02}{00}
#22A8 Did you meet with Babi?{1E}{00}
#22A9 Please lend Babi your{03}assistance.{01}Babi is counting on{03}your help.{02}{00}
#22AA Why aren't you going to{03}meet with Babi to{03}discuss things?{01}He wants to talk to{03}you before you leave.{02}{00}
#22AB So, you're all from the{03}eastern shores of the{03}Karagol Sea, huh?{01}Do you want to go{03}back already?{1E}{00}
#22AC Oh, that's too bad.{05}..that{03}no one will set sail on{03}the Karagol Sea, I mean.{01}Why don't you let Babi{03}take care of you until{03}your ship sails?{02}{00}
#22AD You don't? That's great!{03}Babi will be very happy{03}to hear it.{02}{00}
#22AE I haven't seen much of{03}Babi lately. It's as if he's{03}afraid of something.{01}What in the world{03}could frighten him?{02}{00}
#22AF It would be a waste to{03}let you leave, {11}{01}.{01}I certainly will not{03}tell you how to return{03}to the east.{02}{00}
#22B0 No one's going to sleep{03}in this big bedroom{03}until the next Colosso!{01}Even so, we still have to{03}keep it cleaned up.{03}I hate that!{02}{00}
#22B1 Would this room get very{03}dusty if I didn't clean{03}it all year?{01}Yeah, that won't do.{03}I guess I'll just have{03}to tidy up.{02}{00}
#22B2 Babi was found safe and{03}sound, and Colosso ended{03}without incident.{01}We're relieved{03}everything went so well.{02}{00}
#22B3 Now that Colosso is over,{03}I'm going to Gondowan to{03}build Babi Lighthouse!{02}{00}
#22B4 The southern continent{03}is a dangerous place.{03}If you ever go there,{01}you'll know why I prefer{03}Angara. There truly is{03}no more peaceful land.{02}{00}
#22B5 I was hoping I'd be the{03}one to find Babi! Oh well,{03}it's too late now.{02}{00}
#22B6 Colosso has ended, so we{03}have to go back to{03}building the lighthouse.{01}{05}I still don't get{03}why Babi wants it{03}finished so soon.{02}{00}
#22B7 I want that lighthouse{03}finished quickly, so I can{03}say good-bye to Gondowan.{02}{00}
#22B8 Once Babi Lighthouse is{03}complete, I'd like to{03}move there!{01}I'll spend my time{03}poring over the{03}Venus Ruins.{02}{00}
#22B9 You folks seem to know{03}quite a bit about Kraden,{03}don't you?{1E}{00}
#22BA We haven't heard from{03}him in years... To think{03}he was in your village!{01}I wonder if he ever{03}found the legendary{03}Elemental Stars?{02}{00}
#22BB I'm shocked to hear no{03}one knew he was from{03}here.{01}I wonder why Kraden{03}never told anyone in Vale{03}about Tolbi.{02}{00}
#22BC Alchemy teaches that the{03}four elements, earth,{03}water, fire, and wind...{01}form the basis for{03}everything.{01}You can create{03}anything by combining{03}those elements...{02}{00}
#22BD If the riddle of the{03}Venus Ruins were solved,{03}we wouldn't have to{01}build Babi Lighthouse.{03}We continue to study, but{03}we make little progress.{02}{00}
#22BE I'm sure Kraden would{03}stop by if he ever came{03}through here again.{01}Babi took very good{03}care of Kraden...{02}{00}
#22BF The relationship between{03}Alchemy and the Venus{03}Ruins seems strong.{01}I'll solve the riddle{03}of the lighthouse and{03}show them all!{02}{00}
#22C0 I want to see Kraden{03}and reveal something{03}about Alchemy to him.{02}{00}
#22C1 There's got to be a{03}good reason for calling{03}the four Elementals...{01}the Four Great Bases. If{03}we can find out why, we{03}might turn lead into gold!{02}{00}
#22C2 What sort of unfathomable{03}riddles are hiding in{03}the Venus Ruins?{02}{00}
#22C3 There must be a reason{03}why Kraden has not{03}returned to Tolbi.{02}{00}
#22C4 I've been waiting for{03}you and your companions,{03}{11}{01}!{02}{00}
#22C5 I've been waiting here{03}because I wanted to{03}speak with you.{02}{00}
#22C6 It's hard to talk when {03}you're so far away...{03}Come over here.{02}{00}
#22C7 The battles at Colosso{03}were spectacular!{02}{00}
#22C8 It was most rewarding{03}to see Babi's favored{03}warrior steal the day.{02}{00}
#22C9 Iodem, bring him the{03}victor's prize.{02}{00}
#22CA Yes, sir, right away.{02}{00}
#22CB {11}{01} received{03}{14}{02}.{02}{00}
#22CC Incidentally, {11}{01},{03}are you feeling better{03}now?{1E}{00}
#22CD It was wonderful to see{03}Babi's handpicked{03}warrior make it so far!{02}{00}
#22CE Incidentally, {11}{01},{03}are you feeling better{03}now?{1E}{00}
#22CF Ah, the recuperative{03}powers of youth...and{03}after such fierce battles!{02}{00}
#22D0 You must be exhausted.{03}I'm amazed to see you on{03}your feet after Colosso.{02}{00}
#22D1 Who could expect less{03}from the warriors who{03}rescued me?{02}{00}
#22D2 Enough with the flattery.{03}Let's get to the point:{03}why were we summoned?{02}{00}
#22D3 Such insolence! Who{03}do you think you are,{03}to speak to Babi so?{02}{00}
#22D4 Let it be, Iodem. There{03}are other ways to{03}judge a man.{02}{00}
#22D5 What is it you said you{03}were called?{02}{00}
#22D6 He's talking to{03}you, {11}{02}.{02}{00}
#22D7 That's right, {11}{02}.{03}We shall explain all.{02}{00}
#22D8 We intended to thank you{03}and your companions for{03}saving Babi, {11}{01}.{02}{00}
#22D9 But it would seem that{03}gratitude is not enough...{02}{00}
#22DA I have disclosed{03}everything to Iodem.{02}{00}
#22DB What do you mean{03}by everything?{02}{00}
#22DC You do wish to know{03}more about Lemuria,{03}correct?{1E}{00}
#22DD Yes, indeed... Your desire{03}is as plain as day.{02}{00}
#22DE You can't hide your{03}interest from me. It is{03}written on your faces.{02}{00}
#22DF I have just seen Psynergy{03}for the first time...{03}It is an awesome power...{02}{00}
#22E0 I used my Cloak Ball{03}to show him Psynergy.{02}{00}
#22E1 No one else could see{03}it, but I knew {11}{01}'s{03}tournament was strange.{02}{00}
#22E2 I thought it unlikely{03}that you would fight{03}using such power...{02}{00}
#22E3 No need to be ashamed,{03}{11}{01}. Psynergy{03}is also a warrior's power.{02}{00}
#22E4 When I first learned{03}of your power, I was{03}shocked.{01}I thought you might{03}be Lemurians.{02}{00}
#22E5 You have mentioned{03}Lemuria many times,{03}Babi. What is it?{02}{00}
#22E6 It is the city of an{03}ancient people, lying far{03}out at sea.{02}{00}
#22E7 Many years ago, about the{03}time of the great flood,{03}Babi went to Lemuria.{02}{00}
#22E8 I see...{02}{00}
#22E9 The great flood struck{03}while I was traveling{03}with Lunpa.{02}{00}
#22EA Lunpa... You mean{03}Lunpa the thief?{02}{00}
#22EB I know it is hard to{03}believe... It happened a{03}hundred years ago.{02}{00}
#22EC You mean...those rumors{03}about you are...true?{02}{00}
#22ED Kraden once mentioned the{03}Stone of Sages. Do you{03}think that's what did it?{1E}{00}
#22EE So the stone that grants{03}immortality came from{03}Lemuria?{02}{00}
#22EF Huh? Don't tell me{03}you forgot about{03}the Stone of Sages...{1E}{00}
#22F0 It rules all, can change{03}anything into gold, grants{03}immortality.{05} Ring a bell?{02}{00}
#22F1 I can't think of anything{03}else that would let him{03}live for so long.{02}{00}
#22F2 So you've even heard of{03}the Stone of Sages... I'm{03}afraid I don't have it.{02}{00}
#22F3 It is the draught of{03}Lemuria that has allowed{03}me to live for so long.{02}{00}
#22F4 The draught of{03}Lemuria?{02}{00}
#22F5 It is a magical draught{03}once taken by those{03}who lived in Lemuria.{02}{00}
#22F6 And just drinking stops{03}you from aging?{02}{00}
#22F7 Is that what it does?{02}{00}
#22F8 Hmmm...{05} It would be{03}more accurate to say it{03}slows the aging process.{02}{00}
#22F9 There is death in{03}Lemuria...{02}{00}
#22FA But it only comes to those{03}whose senses have failed{03}from centuries of use.{02}{00}
#22FB Do the people of Lemuria{03}use Psynergy, like we do?{02}{00}
#22FC You have that draught,{03}Babi... That's why you've{03}lived so long.{02}{00}
#22FD And become wealthy{03}enough to rule Tolbi.{02}{00}
#22FE What are you{03}getting at?{02}{00}
#22FF What is your purpose{03}in making everyone{03}study Alchemy?{02}{00}
#2300 I'm starting to wonder{03}myself. What do you hope{03}to gain, Babi?{02}{00}
#2301 Ah. If I had attained{03}true immortality...{01}There would be{03}no need for all{03}this research.{02}{00}
#2302 I'm not sure I understand.{02}{00}
#2303 I had precious little{03}draught, and now I{03}am running out.{02}{00}
#2304 You all saw it. There{03}was but little left in{03}the cave...{02}{00}
#2305 How long will it last?{03}And what will happen{03}when it runs out?{02}{00}
#2306 It will run out any day{03}now. And when it does,{03}my life is at its end...{02}{00}
#2307 Why didn't you tell us{03}sooner? We must hurry{03}to Lemuria!{02}{00}
#2308 It is pointless...{02}{00}
#2309 What on earth do you{03}mean, pointless?{02}{00}
#230A We cannot find{03}Lemuria.{02}{00}
#230B But you just said that{03}it lies far out at{03}sea...{02}{00}
#230C If we search the seas,{03}we're sure to find it!{02}{00}
#230D I've sent so many ships{03}in the past in{03}search of Lemuria.{02}{00}
#230E This must have been long{03}before I joined you... But{03}still you failed?{02}{00}
#230F I needed more Lemurian{03}draught, but I couldn't{03}find Lemuria.{02}{00}
#2310 Why did you collapse{03}in the cave if you{03}still had more draught?{02}{00}
#2311 I have been rationing it,{03}but this time, I waited{03}too long between drinks.{02}{00}
#2312 You were trying to make{03}it last longer...{02}{00}
#2313 I overexerted myself{03}trying to find Lemuria{03}before it ran out.{02}{00}
#2314 And your reason for{03}calling us here has{03}to do with Lemuria?{02}{00}
#2315 Exactly. I want you{03}to find Lemuria.{02}{00}
#2316 I have not been able{03}to locate Lemuria by{03}sea, but perhaps by air...{02}{00}
#2317 I can hide it no longer...{01}I have built Babi{03}Lighthouse to see if I can{03}find Lemuria at sea.{02}{00}
#2318 What? That's why you're{03}building the lighthouse?{02}{00}
#2319 No, there's more to{03}it than that.{02}{00}
#231A We've  spotted something{03}in the ocean southeast{03}of the lighthouse.{05}.{05}.{01}where Lemuria{03}should be.{02}{00}
#231B Something dangerous, no{03}doubt. What, monsters?{03}We can handle 'em...{02}{00}
#231C That may be...{03}However, something else{03}troubles me more.{02}{00}
#231D What is it, my lord?{02}{00}
#231E No sailor has been able{03}to keep his bearings{03}at sea.{02}{00}
#231F You're kidding! You mean{03}they can't even keep a{03}straight course?{02}{00}
#2320 Is there something that{03}distorts distance or{03}direction or something?{02}{00}
#2321 The currents shift there,{03}subtly changing a ship's{03}direction.{02}{00}
#2322 So the lighthouse will{03}help the ships keep{03}their bearings...{02}{00}
#2323 So, how exactly did you{03}get away from Lemuria{03}after the flood, Babi?{02}{00}
#2324 That is the thing,{03}{11}{02}!{02}{00}
#2325 I crossed the sea in a{03}Lemurian ship. I am hoping{03}you can sail it...{02}{00}
#2326 But why us, when you{03}have so many powerful{03}soldiers at your disposal?{02}{00}
#2327 None of them have the{03}ability to use Psynergy.{02}{00}
#2328 One must have Psynergy{03}to sail this ship!{02}{00}
#2329 Then that would mean{03}that Babi is an Adept,{03}wouldn't it?{1E}{00}
#232A That must be it. No{03}normal person could use{03}that Cloak Ball.{02}{00}
#232B But, {11}{01}, no normal{03}person could master{03}the Cloak Ball!{02}{00}
#232C I learned to use a little{03}Psynergy during my stay{03}in Lemuria.{02}{00}
#232D With what little I'd{03}learned, I was able{03}to guide the ship.{02}{00}
#232E In that case, perhaps...{03}I could sail the ship.{02}{00}
#232F No. It must be an Adept.{02}{00}
#2330 What should we do,{03}{11}{01}? Will you do{03}what he wants?{02}{00}
#2331 If you do, I will{03}grant you whatever{03}you wish.{02}{00}
#2332 You shouldn't make vows{03}you will later find{03}you cannot keep...{02}{00}
#2333 I haven't even{03}considered my own{03}wishes lately.{02}{00}
#2334 In that case, I could{03}provide you with a wealth{03}of items you might like.{02}{00}
#2335 Babi's offer is very{03}generous... You will{03}consider going, won't you?{1E}{00}
#2336 {11}{01}, we have to{03}beat {11}{05} and the{03}others to the lighthouse.{02}{00}
#2337 Not this time. We have to{03}beat {11}{05} and the{03}others to the lighthouse.{02}{00}
#2338 The lighthouse!?{02}{00}
#2339 Do you mean Venus{03}Lighthouse?{02}{00}
#233A Well then, our paths are{03}intertwined. I, too, must{03}go to Venus Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#233B But we cannot get to{03}the top of Venus{03}Lighthouse, can we?{02}{00}
#233C These Adepts may be able{03}to solve the riddle{03}that blocks us.{02}{00}
#233D Ah, I see... The thought{03}hadn't occurred to me.{02}{00}
#233E {11}{01}! You shall go{03}to Venus Lighthouse{03}with Iodem.{02}{00}
#233F Do not worry...{01}You can take care of{03}your own business{03}first.{02}{00}
#2340 I see... If they can solve{03}the riddle of the{03}lighthouse...{01}then our own wishes{03}will have been fulfilled.{02}{00}
#2341 So, we can search for{03}Lemuria after they{03}complete their own quest...{02}{00}
#2342 Is that acceptable?{1E}{00}
#2343 Ah, you will undertake{03}this quest! I am most{03}grateful!{02}{00}
#2344 If you need time to make{03}up your mind, then{03}please do so.{02}{00}
#2345 In any case, you will{03}need my assistance to{03}reach the lighthouse.{02}{00}
#2346 I'll make preparations{03}so that I am ready to{03}leave at any time.{02}{00}
#2347 I take my leave now{03}to make preparations.{02}{00}
#2348 Then you can all meet{03}at Gondowan Passage...{02}{00}
#2349 That's a brilliant idea!{02}{00}
#234A One more thing. I'd like{03}you to think about a{03}suitable reward.{02}{00}
#234B Yes. I will take care{03}of that immediately,{03}as well.{02}{00}
#234C I shall be waiting for{03}you at the passage.{02}{00}
#234D Your first task shall be{03}the riddles of Venus{03}Lighthouse.{01}I am counting on{03}you, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#234E Sleeping a lot helps{03}to delay the need to{03}drink more draught.{01}If you find Lemuria and{03}return with more draught,{03}I won't have to do this.{02}{00}
#234F Babi's face is very{03}pale, like that of{03}a dead man.{01}It's no use worrying,{03}though. There's nothing{03}we can do about it.{02}{00}
#2350 I wish I had met you and{03}your companions sooner,{03}{11}{01}.{01}But I suppose it was{03}not fated to be...{02}{00}
#2351 If something happens to{03}Babi, what will become of{03}Tolbi?{01}Just thinking about{03}it frightens me.{02}{00}
#2352 You found the{03}Cloak Ball.{02}{00}
#2353 {11}{01}! Is that Cloak{03}Ball what you desire?{1E}{00}
#2354 Then please leave the{03}Cloak Ball alone.{01}Do not worry about{03}your reward. Iodem has{03}prepared it for you.{02}{00}
#2355 That Cloak Ball is very{03}precious to me.{03}I can't just give it away.{01}But perhaps you could{03}borrow it. Take it with{03}you on your quest.{02}{00}
#2356 You got the Cloak Ball.{02}{00}
#2357 If you use the Cloak Ball{03}in the shadows, monsters{03}won't be able to see you.{01}That's how I was able{03}to get through{03}Altmiller Cave.{02}{00}
#2358 Why would an Adept like{03}you need the Cloak Ball,{03}{11}{01}?{02}{00}
#2359 The girl from Lalivero{03}is no longer here.{01}She has left for Lalivero{03}with the soldiers going{03}to Babi Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#235A I am surprised {11}{07} was{03}allowed to return to{03}Lalivero like that.{01}At least she won't be{03}homesick any longer.{02}{00}
#235B It seemed only natural{03}that {11}{07} should{03}return to Lalivero...{01}But who ordered it?{02}{00}
#235C I am so relieved {11}{07}{03}has returned to her{03}hometown.{01}But now that she's{03}gone, I find I miss{03}her a little.{02}{00}
#235D Well, this year's Colosso{03}has ended.{01}Be sure to come to Tolbi{03}again for next year's{03}festival, okay?{02}{00}
#235E It's back to our normal{03}quiet lives, now that{03}Colosso is over?{01}Oh, man! I'm bored!{02}{00}
#235F You were in the finals,{03}weren't you?{1E}{00}
#2360 I was moved by how you{03}were so determined,{03}despite your size.{02}{00}
#2361 What? You weren't?{03}You know, you look just{03}like that warrior.{02}{00}
#2362 With all those revelers{03}gone, the town sure feels{03}empty...{01}The period right after{03}the festival is unbearably{03}lonesome, huh?{02}{00}
#2363 I had no luck in{03}the Lucky Guess. Maybe{03}next year will go better.{02}{00}
#2364 It's so quiet! The hustle{03}and bustle of Colosso{03}seems like a dream!{02}{00}
#2365 Yay! It's really easy{03}to run with no one{03}around.{02}{00}
#2366 Ha ha ha ha. This is{03}fun! My big brother is{03}being nice to me again!{02}{00}
#2367 I'll be back to do{03}business in Tolbi{03}again next year.{02}{00}
#2368 Hey there, these are{03}leftovers, but have some!{02}{00}
#2369 You got some corn.{02}{00}
#236A The festival was longer{03}than usual this year,{03}so I made more money.{01}I hope it's long again{03}next year.{02}{00}
#236B The spectators have all{03}left, so we have to clean.{03}What a pain!{02}{00}
#236C Think how fun it would{03}be to have Colosso all{03}year long!{01}Whew! That would be{03}a lot of work for us!{02}{00}
#236D All the warriors who{03}gain fame in the finals{03}become Babi's soldiers.{01}That's why Babi's{03}soldiers are so{03}powerful.{02}{00}
#236E Come to think of it,{03}no ships are sailing{03}in the Karagol, are they?{01}How are all the tourists{03}going to get home?{02}{00}
#236F Hmm... Since Colosso{03}ended so dramatically, the{03}Lucky Guess goes to...{01}Dang. Just a bit more{03}luck, and I could've been{03}a very wealthy man...{02}{00}
#2370 The calm after the storm{03}is pretty nice too,{03}don't you think?{02}{00}
#2371 The main street in Tolbi{03}is so wide open!{02}{00}
#2372 My brother was mean to{03}me during the festival.{03}He changed completely!{02}{00}
#2373 Every year I try to sell{03}everything, but I always{03}have stuff left over.{01}How am I supposed to{03}carry all this stuff{03}home?{02}{00}
#2374 How can we get home if{03}sea monsters are{03}blocking the crossing?{02}{00}
#2375 Now that Colosso is over,{03}we've closed our{03}makeshift inn.{02}{00}
#2376 We had a lot of guests{03}again this year.{01}Maybe we'll take a{03}trip with all the{03}money we made.{02}{00}
#2377 Sigh... Making the beds{03}has worn me out!{01}I'm going to enjoy myself{03}for a while with{03}the money I made.{02}{00}
#2378 I'd love a vacation,{03}but where should{03}we go?{01}We can't get to Kalay,{03}and there's nothing{03}to see in Gondowan!{02}{00}
#2379 I rented my house to a{03}rich family and tried{03}to head east...{01}but Silk Road is blocked,{03}and nobody's taking people{03}across the Karagol!{02}{00}
#237A The tourists are all in{03}a fix, because the ships{03}aren't sailing.{01}If we just had a few{03}Colosso warriors, we{03}could make it.{02}{00}
#237B Once the ships start{03}sailing again, I think{03}we'll go to Kalay.{02}{00}
#237C I heard of a cave that{03}leads to the Karagol's{03}far shore somewhere.{02}{00}
#237D I was so moved by{03}this year's Colosso!{01}I already can't wait for{03}next year's Colosso!{02}{00}
#237E That little guy jumped{03}straight into battle with{03}those huge gladiators!{01}It was amazing!{03}This was the best{03}Colosso ever!{02}{00}
#237F The warriors who fought{03}in the finals were{03}incredible!{02}{00}
#2380 Daring and bravery are{03}nice and all{05}, but I'll{03}leave it to the warriors.{02}{00}
#2381 Did you know Mt. Aleph{03}erupted? It wreaked{03}havoc across the land.{01}Maybe that's why Colosso{03}had so few spectators{03}this year.{02}{00}
#2382 Maybe Aleph's eruption{03}caused those sea monsters{03}to appear in the Karagol.{02}{00}
#2383 The sparkling stones that{03}rained from the sky...{01}They couldn't have{03}been volcanic rock,{03}could they?{02}{00}
#2384 I'll bet the monsters were{03}frightened by the eruption{03}and went wild.{02}{00}
#2385 The warriors said they{03}would rush to finish the{03}lighthouse after Colosso.{01}I'd love to see it{03}once it's finished.{02}{00}
#2386 There won't be many{03}customers until next{03}year's festival,{01}so I'll be traveling{03}around selling my wares{03}until then.{02}{00}
#2387 It bothers me a bit{03}that they're building the{03}lighthouse in Gondowan.{02}{00}
#2388 There aren't many{03}merchants at the{03}lighthouse yet.{01}I'm sure I can make a{03}tidy sum there.{02}{00}
#2389 Did you come all the{03}way from Kalay?{1E}{00}
#238A It's too bad you can't{03}go back...{01}Looks like you're stuck{03}until the road is{03}repaired.{02}{00}
#238B The people visiting from{03}the east are all stuck at{03}Karagol Sea Port.{02}{00}
#238C Even without the ships,{03}I could still break even{03}if they just fix the road.{01}I would give just{03}about anything for{03}that to happen!{02}{00}
#238D You're {11}{01}, right?{03}The one that did so well{03}in the finals!{01}I'm amazed someone as{03}skinny as you could{03}do that well!{02}{00}
#238E Did all the warriors who{03}fought in the finals{03}become Babi's soldiers?{02}{00}
#238F I wasn't able to watch{03}the finals this year!{01}My mother says that{03}a new warrior named{03}{11}{01} did really well.{02}{00}
#2390 I'm gonna watch the{03}finals next year{03}for sure!{02}{00}
#2391 I thought we'd have some{03}free time once Colosso{03}ended, but no!{01}The spectators from Kalay{03}are back because they{03}can't get back home.{02}{00}
#2392 The spectators from the{03}east can't go back home...{03}It's just awful.{02}{00}
#2393 It's busy all day,{03}every day! I'm so busy{03}my head is spinning!{01}Sheesh! I thought{03}we'd get to take it{03}easy after Colosso!{02}{00}
#2394 Hey, what's this?{02}{00}
#2395 Uh-oh.{02}{00}
#2396 I didn't find anything!{02}{00}
#2397 I was just doing some{03}work I...had to do.{02}{00}
#2398 It's rude to startle{03}people!{02}{00}
#2399 Hee hee! Do I look like{03}I'm that excited?{1E}{00}
#239A I see. That must be{03}because the weather{03}is nice.{02}{00}
#239B Yeah! I'm the same{03}as always.{02}{00}
#239C Oh... Hello!{02}{00}
#239D Ho hum. I'm fine.{03}It's nothing.{02}{00}
#239E You look like a warrior,{03}but you were watching{03}Colosso, right?{1E}{00}
#239F Tsk! Just watching{03}doesn't make you any{03}better than the next guy!{01}If you're a warrior,{03}you ought to fight{03}next time.{02}{00}
#23A0 Oh? Didn't even watch?{01}What are you, crazy?{03}Colosso is the best{03}thing ever!{02}{00}
#23A1 Grrr! The chef is in a{03}bad mood because he{03}didn't get to see Colosso!{01}Taking that out on{03}us isn't very mature!{02}{00}
#23A2 I went to the port, but{03}they said the ships aren't{03}sailing, so I came back.{01}We made it to Tolbi{03}with your help. Maybe{03}we could make it back...{02}{00}
#23A3 Colosso has ended, but{03}we still can't get{03}across the Karagol.{01}Maybe they'll row us{03}home if we agree{03}to help out again...{02}{00}
#23A4 He won't sail the ship,{03}even though we agreed{03}to do whatever it takes?{02}{00}
#23A5 Co{05}-Correct. The ships{03}cannot go out for{03}any reason.{02}{00}
#23A6 What kind of person{03}would refuse such an{03}offer?{02}{00}
#23A7 You tell the captain{03}again that he needs to{03}set sail tomorrow.{02}{00}
#23A8 Grrr! What a scam! Why{03}won't they let the ships{03}sail out after Colosso!?{02}{00}
#23A9 Once this guy gets{03}mad, there's no{03}controlling him.{02}{00}
#23AA I wonder if this{03}really is the best{03}room in the place.{02}{00}
#23AB Tolbi gets so boring{03}once the festival ends!{03}I wanna go home!{02}{00}
#23AC Hey! You're the would-be{03}warrior! Do you{03}remember me?{1E}{00}
#23AD You do? Wow! That's{03}great!{01}Neither of us can get{03}back to Kalay... We're{03}stuck, aren't we!{02}{00}
#23AE It's me! We rode the{03}same ship from Kalay!{03}I guess you forgot.{02}{00}
#23AF I got to see Colosso, so{03}I don't care if I can't{03}get across the Karagol.{01}Those warriors who{03}fought in Colosso were{03}incredibly built.{02}{00}
#23B0 Since the ships aren't{03}sailing, the port is{03}full of stranded tourists.{02}{00}
#23B1 Hee hee. It's great! The{03}inns are still full{03}even after Colosso.{02}{00}
#23B2 Everyone is working on{03}Babi Lighthouse, so{03}there's no one to rebuild{01}the road! Looks like the{03}inns will be full for{03}quite a while!{02}{00}
#23B3 Heh heh! She just hid{03}that thing she found{03}behind that trash pile.{01}Nobody will ever know{03}it's there...{02}{00}
#23B4 That thing I found is{03}definitely the same as the{03}one that man showed me.{01}But he wouldn't{05} ask me{03}to return it, would he?{02}{00}
#23B5 Grrr! I didn't get to{03}see any of Colosso!{01}Sigh. I'm trying not to{03}think about it, but...I get{03}so mad, it makes me sick.{02}{00}
#23B6 Hey, Chef! So what if{03}you missed it again?{03}Grow up, you big baby!{02}{00}
#23B7 I tried going to the{03}eastern cave, but it's{03}impossible to get through.{01}It was just like the{03}guards at the gate{03}told us.{02}{00}
#23B8 You'd think you could{03}get through the cave east{03}of Gondowan Passage...{01}but you can't. Not unless{03}you can lift boulders,{03}at any rate.{02}{00}
#23B9 You're saying if we row,{03}we can set sail? If that's{03}a joke, it's not funny.{01}Making passengers row{03}their own cruise ship is{03}unprecedented!{02}{00}
#23BA The crew is saying that{03}if we all row, the ship{03}can depart.{01}My husband's pretty{03}mad about it!{02}{00}
#23BB I'm sick of staying at{03}this miserable inn!{01}I'm willing to pay{03}extra if I can stay{03}at Babi Palace!{02}{00}
#23BC If Mom had just bought{03}me some souvenirs, this{03}would be more fun.{02}{00}
#23BD That voyage across the{03}sea was frightful!{03}I've learned my lesson.{02}{00}
#23BE No matter what happens,{03}I'm coming to see Colosso{03}next year for sure!{02}{00}
#23BF If the ships aren't going,{03}why not forget heading{03}east and enjoy Tolbi?{02}{00}
#23C0 You all got to see{03}Colosso, so quit griping!{01}I wanted to go, too,{03}but I missed the{03}whole blasted thing!{02}{00}
#23C1 Colosso is over and the{03}colosseum will be{03}closed until next year.{01}Since you've come all{03}this way, take a long look{03}at the beautiful gates!{02}{00}
#23C2 Did you come to get{03}your Lucky Guess prize{03}money?{1E}{00}
#23C3 I'm pretty sure that{03}{12}{01}, the guy{03}you bet on, won!{01}Here are your winnings.{03}Please take them.{02}{00}
#23C4 It takes a great deal of{03}luck to win at{03}Lucky Guess!{02}{00}
#23C5 Really? But we already{03}paid out all the prize{03}money to the winners.{02}{00}
#23C6 You got {16} coin{19}.{02}{00}
#23C7 You didn't? Well, the{03}colosseum is closed{03}until next year.{01}If you want to look{03}inside, you'll have{03}to wait until then.{02}{00}
#23C8 The colosseum is closed{03}until next year.{01}If you want to look{03}inside, you'll have to{03}come back then.{02}{00}
#23C9 When the colosseum gates{03}finally shut, that truly{03}marks the end of Colosso.{02}{00}
#23CA I'm waiting here 'cause{03}he told me to give him{03}his Lucky Guess winnings,{01}but that warrior still{03}hasn't shown up.{02}{00}
#23CB The fighting at this{03}year's Colosso was{03}incredible!{01}Standing in front of{03}this lonely gate makes{03}me kind of sad.{02}{00}
#23CC Do you wish to cross{03}into Gondowan?{1E}{00}
#23CD I won't stop you, but{03}I wouldn't go unless{03}I had business there.{01}I'd go to Tolbi and watch{03}Colosso. That's what{03}I'd do.{02}{00}
#23CE That's a good idea. They{03}wouldn't let you into{03}Babi Lighthouse, anyway.{02}{00}
#23CF Us? We're the soldiers{03}who guard the bridge{03}to Gondowan.{01}It's not like anyone's{03}ever going to attack{03}this bridge, though,{01}so there's not{03}much sense in{03}guarding it.{02}{00}
#23D0 Even if you head east,{03}you can't get to Kalay{03}from here, even!{01}A few reckless warriors{03}have tried, but none have{03}ever returned!{02}{00}
#23D1 Those who go to Gondowan{03}rarely go knowing what{03}it will be like.{01}I wouldn't even{03}think of going there.{02}{00}
#23D2 The warriors have been{03}fighting while we've{03}been guarding this{01}bridge. Being on duty{03}at a time like this is{03}plain old bad luck!{02}{00}
#23D3 You'd think you could{03}get through the cave{03}to the east...{01}But it's absolutely{03}impossible to get{03}through that cave.{02}{00}
#23D4 I won't stop you, but{03}I wouldn't go unless{03}I had business there!{02}{00}
#23D5 We missed all of Colosso{03}because we were stuck{03}guarding this bridge.{01}Sheesh... Talk about{03}unlucky!{02}{00}
#23D6 Why would Iodem choose{03}to wait for us in a{03}place like this?{01}I get nervous when{03}I feel like I'm{03}being watched.{02}{00}
#23D7 We haven't seen anybody{03}unusual crossing the{03}bridge today.{01}Come to think of it,{03}there was a group of six{03}strange-looking folk...{02}{00}
#23D8 Even if you go east{03}from here, you won't{03}end up in Kalay!{01}A few reckless warriors{03}have tried, but none{01}ever came back!{02}{00}
#23D9 I've been waiting for you,{03}{11}{01}! We should go to{03}Babi Lighthouse soon.{02}{00}
#23DA Why are you going back,{03}{11}{01}?{01}Do you need to get{03}something you left{03}behind?{1E}{00}
#23DB I see... In that case,{03}I shall wait here for{03}you to return.{02}{00}
#23DC Then we should continue{03}on our way to the{03}lighthouse.{02}{00}
#23DD Iodem is going to Babi{03}Lighthouse? It must be{03}very near completion.{02}{00}
#23DE It's a lot of stress, but{03}I'm a diligent worker, so{03}I can handle it.{01}Just act natural and{03}ignore Iodem... There's{03}nothing to worry about.{02}{00}
#23DF Everyone comes down this{03}way when they find they{03}can't cross the Karagol.{01}They all have to try the{03}cave themselves, despite{03}what I tell them.{02}{00}
#23E0 We have to head for the{03}lighthouse quickly so we{03}can save Babi.{02}{00}
#23E1 There are many here who{03}want to return to Kalay{03}since Colosso is over.{01}But the ships won't{03}sail without the captain's{03}order.{02}{00}
#23E2 Hanging around here like{03}this and staring out at{03}the sea is boring!{02}{00}
#23E3 If both the captain and{03}Kaja say the ship's not{03}sailing, it's not.{02}{00}
#23E4 If Kaja and the others{03}say it's okay, I'd like to{03}head out to sea again.{02}{00}
#23E5 I'm stuck... I want to{03}cross the Karagol, but{03}the ships won't set sail.{02}{00}
#23E6 Yeah...the ship's not{03}going anywhere for{03}now.{01}Some rich guy was here{03}throwing money around,{03}but they still said no.{02}{00}
#23E7 The Karagol Sea looks so{03}calm from here. How can{03}it be dangerous?{02}{00}
#23E8 We've got passengers, but{03}nobody's sailing. How can{03}we sell any tickets?{02}{00}
#23E9 The captain must be a{03}stubborn man. With so{03}much money to be made,{01}I can't believe he won't{03}sail... Who cares how{03}dangerous it is?{02}{00}
#23EA The marine-blue Karagol{03}Sea is such a romantic{03}sight to behold!{01}It really takes me back,{03}and I get all sentimental.{03}{09}{04}Sniff...{07}{02}{00}
#23EB I returned the cost of{03}your ticket to you.{03}Let's leave it at that.{02}{00}
#23EC Why should I, when all{03}you did was give me{03}what's mine!?{02}{00}
#23ED Isn't the tour group{03}responsible for getting{03}us back to Kalay?{02}{00}
#23EE With the road blocked and{03}the ships stuck here, we{03}have no way to get home.{02}{00}
#23EF You brought us all here!{03}Take responsibility for{03}it! Responsibility!{02}{00}
#23F0 Must you really resort{03}to violence?{02}{00}
#23F1 What are you{18}{02}{00}
#23F2 I was hired for just{03}this sort of thing...{02}{00}
#23F3 You mean, you hired{03}{05}a bodyguard?{02}{00}
#23F4 Yeah! Because of rabble-{03}rousing customers like{03}you!{02}{00}
#23F5 We've asked this nice man{03}to act as a guard...for{03}everyone's safety.{02}{00}
#23F6 What are you talking{03}about?{02}{00}
#23F7 I wouldn't go any{03}farther than that if I{03}were you!{02}{00}
#23F8 Ge{05}-Get outta my way!{02}{00}
#23F9 Sorry, but I was hired{03}to BE in your way!{03}Please. Let it go...{02}{00}
#23FA This is ridiculous!{02}{00}
#23FB I know... And after I{03}asked him so nicely...{02}{00}
#23FC You're wasting time on{03}this!? Why don't you find{03}a way to get us home?{02}{00}
#23FD Tour groups should take{03}care of you from start{03}to finish, but...{01}it's not our fault the{03}ship won't sail, so we{03}can't offer any refunds.{02}{00}
#23FE To heck with you! I'm{03}staying right here until{03}the ship leaves!{02}{00}
#23FF Sigh. I wonder when{03}we'll be able to{03}return to Kalay.{02}{00}
#2400 We'll be counting on you{03}if something comes up{03}again, Master.{02}{00}
#2401 As long as we're stuck{03}here, I might as well make{03}some cash as a bodyguard.{02}{00}
#2402 Sigh. If I knew it would{03}turn out like this, we{03}wouldn't have come.{02}{00}
#2403 If they'd just let the ship{03}sail, the passengers{03}would stop complaining.{02}{00}
#2404 If I'm going to be stuck{03}here, I should find work{03}and make some money.{02}{00}
#2405 Grrr! Why don't you get{03}up off your back and do{03}something!{02}{00}
#2406 As long as you're here,{03}we can stay without being{03}yelled at!{02}{00}
#2407 This tour wasn't well{03}organized. That's why I{03}have to provide security.{01}I have conflicting{03}feelings about protecting{03}them.{02}{00}
#2408 I wonder if Grandma is{03}doing okay now...{02}{00}
#2409 Hey, hey! Who are you!{02}{00}
#240A That's strange. I've been{03}on watch this whole time,{03}so how did you get here?{02}{00}
#240B Regardless, no one{03}is allowed in!{02}{00}
#240C That's right. No one is{03}allowed in! Off with you{03}now! Off, I say!{02}{00}
#240D Who are you?{02}{00}
#240E How did you get in here?{02}{00}
#240F No matter! You're on{03}your way out now!{02}{00}
#2410 And don't come back!{02}{00}
#2411 Huh? I could swear I{03}just heard someone!{02}{00}
#2412 You're crazy! Still, this{03}place {09}{02}is{07} kind of creepy.{03}I never did like it here!{02}{00}
#2413 Ain't nobody gettin' in!{01}I don't even know why{03}we have to stay on guard{03}all the time.{02}{00}
#2414 Hammet, the great{03}merchant of Kalay, is our{03}best source of income.{01}I will keep you safe{03}no matter what happens.{02}{00}
#2415 Z-z-z-z Z-z-z-z-z...{03}It's so warm today! My{03}eyes are getting heavy.{02}{00}
#2416 Dodonpa's orders are{03}absolute!{01}No one will ever get{03}by me and into the{03}fortress!{02}{00}
#2417 Sigh. It's too bad I{03}couldn't go to Tolbi{03}this year.{01}I wonder how Colosso{03}turned out.{02}{00}
#2418 That's strange!? I could{03}swear there's someone{03}right nearby...!{01}Maybe it's just{03}'cause I'm so tired.{02}{00}
#2419 I'll take care of{03}anybody that might{03}show up!{02}{00}
#241A I was told to stand{03}guard, so I am{05}, but I'm{03}actually a coward!{01}I'm serious! I just{03}hope no one shows{03}up on my watch.{02}{00}
#241B Who is disrupting{03}my sleep???{02}{00}
#241C Who is disrupting{03}my sleep???{02}{00}
#241D Who is disrupting{03}my sleep???{02}{00}
#241E Hey! Intruder!{02}{00}
#241F You think you're{03}going any farther?{02}{00}
#2420 Sorry, but you're gonna{03}have to fight your{03}way through.{02}{00}
#2421 Huh? Who's that?{02}{00}
#2422 You're pretty bold to{03}come charging into{03}a den of thieves.{02}{00}
#2423 But your luck ran out{03}when you ran into me!{03}Show me your stuff!{02}{00}
#2424 Is my shift up{03}already?{02}{00}
#2425 ...Wait a minute!{03}Who are you?{02}{00}
#2426 I've never seen you{03}before! Intruder!{02}{00}
#2427 Come on! You'll have{03}to deal with me!{02}{00}
#2428 You scoundrel!{02}{00}
#2429 Dodonpa always said you'd{03}come, and here you are!{02}{00}
#242A If I stop you here,{03}Dodonpa will finally{03}reward me!{02}{00}
#242B What a stroke of luck!{03}My time has finally come!{02}{00}
#242C Poor, poor Donpa.{03}Dodonpa's behavior is{03}driving him into despair.{01}Donpa can't last much{03}longer like this...{02}{00}
#242D Nearly all of these women{03}were brought here{03}against their will, like me.{01}Sigh. I want to go back{03}to my hometown just{03}one more time.{02}{00}
#242E Wh{05}-Wh{05}-Who goes there!{02}{00}
#242F Wh{05}-Who are you?{02}{00}
#2430 You don't look nearly{03}as mean as the thieves{03}in the fortress.{02}{00}
#2431 Did you sneak into Lunpa{03}Fortress in search of{03}something?{1E}{00}
#2432 The great merchant{03}Hammet? I'd tell you{03}if I knew, but I don't.{02}{00}
#2433 Who would sneak into{03}such a dangerous{03}place just for fun?{02}{00}
#2434 I won't tell anyone, but{03}you should leave before{03}the guards find you.{02}{00}
#2435 Maybe that merchant is{03}the reason they've closed{03}off the lower caves...{02}{00}
#2436 If Donpa dies, Dodonpa{03}will be even more...{01}I get scared just{03}thinking about it.{02}{00}
#2437 I know Donpa would let{03}us go if he were well...{01}I hope he gets{03}better soon!{02}{00}
#2438 Who are you!?{02}{00}
#2439 Could this be the guy{03}who's come to get{03}Hammet back?{02}{00}
#243A Yeah! I bet he is!{02}{00}
#243B What a bold rascal!{02}{00}
#243C Dodonpa will be livid{03}if we lose Hammet!{02}{00}
#243D We're really going to be{03}in for it if we let{03}these kids get away.{02}{00}
#243E You're not going any{03}farther! Not without some{03}serious bruises, anyway!{02}{00}
#243F You guys are tougher than{03}we thought{18}we'll let{03}you go this time.{01}Get outta here.{02}{00}
#2440 All right, all right.{03}We give up! If you're{03}here for Hammet,{01}he's down in the{03}cave! Go get{03}him already!{02}{00}
#2441 Owww! Hey! Don't hurt{03}me again, you{03}thieving scoundrel!{01}I hate your guts. Go down{03}to the cave and save{03}your precious Hammet.{02}{00}
#2442 Who'd have thought they'd{03}be so tough? We never{03}shoulda fought 'em.{02}{00}
#2443 Hammet's down in that{03}treacherous cave.{01}They won't be able{03}to save him, though...{03}They'll see.{02}{00}
#2444 At least those punks{03}won't find the switch{03}that opens the door.{01}Heh heh! It's hidden too{03}well in the wall!{02}{00}
#2445 Donpa is supposed to be{03}old. I wonder what he's{03}fighting with in the{01}fortress.{01}That's why he's been in{03}poor form and spends his{03}time resting. What are{01}you going to do?{02}{00}
#2446 Where could Dodonpa be?{03}He's not in his room,{03}but he couldn't have left.{02}{00}
#2447 Whee! Thanks to Hammet{03}we can enjoy food{03}and drink all day long!{02}{00}
#2448 With Hammet here, we can{03}milk as much money as{03}we want out of Kalay.{01}He's a money tree for{03}us, hic!{02}{00}
#2449 Is there anyone in the{03}fortress who can face{03}Donpa in battle?{01}No one is allowed into{03}the cave to find out.{02}{00}
#244A Dodonpa's wife was{03}looking for him, but she{03}can't find him anywhere.{02}{00}
#244B We can eat all we like!{03}It was all bought with{03}the money from Kalay!{01}I love gorging myself{03}for free!{02}{00}
#244C As long as we have{03}Hammet, all of Kalay's{03}earnings will be ours.{02}{00}
#244D Z-z-z-z... Z-z-z-z...{02}{00}
#244E Father...I'm so sorry{03}about Dodonpa.{01}Someone will teach{03}him a lesson someday.{02}{00}
#244F Shhh! Please don't{03}wake Donpa!{02}{00}
#2450 He's been driven to{03}despair after battling{03}a terrible foe.{02}{00}
#2451 It is all because{03}of that Dodonpa!{02}{00}
#2452 Are you the one{05} who{03}Donpa said would come{03}to punish Dodonpa?{1E}{00}
#2453 Donpa has waited a{03}very long time for you.{02}{00}
#2454 Oh, you're not? Well...can{03}you do it anyway?{03}Someone has to do it!{02}{00}
#2455 Donpa knows that he{03}coddled Dodonpa too{03}much as a child.{02}{00}
#2456 It pains him so much.{03}He can't die with things{03}the way they are.{02}{00}
#2457 Maybe if Dodonpa's eyes{03}are opened, Lunpa will{03}be a good place again.{02}{00}
#2458 If someone would punish{03}Dodonpa, I'm sure Donpa{03}would offer a reward.{01}He might even give{03}that person Dodonpa's{03}ill-gotten goods.{02}{00}
#2459 Do you know where{03}Dodonpa is?{1E}{00}
#245A Really? That's fine,{03}as long as he's in the{03}fortress.{02}{00}
#245B Sigh. Don't tell me he's{03}gone off, trying to{03}relive his youth again...{01}I take my eyes off him{03}for a minute, and he's off{03}chasing a new sweetheart.{02}{00}
#245C Papa misbehaves and{03}makes Mama worry.{01}I have to be good{03}so Mama won't have{03}to worry so much.{02}{00}
#245D Papa always gets friendly{03}with the ladies when{03}Mama's not lookin'.{01}That's why Mama always{03}keeps a sharp eye on{03}Papa.{02}{00}
#245E Dodonpa's child is so well{03}behaved, I can't believe{03}he's his father's son!{01}It's a pity that child{03}can't have an{03}innocent childhood.{02}{00}
#245F We've already decided{03}that Donpappa will be{03}Dodonpa's successor!{01}At least that tradition{03}won't change!{02}{00}
#2460 When my Papa's gone, I,{03}Donpappa, shall protect{03}Lunpa myself.{02}{00}
#2461 I'm not going to marry{03}anyone like my Papa{03}when I grow up!{02}{00}
#2462 Being watched by Donpappa{03}makes me feel like I'm{03}being judged.{02}{00}
#2463 {11}{01} pulled the{03}switch.{02}{00}
#2464 Is it time to eat?{02}{00}
#2465 ...Who are you?{02}{00}
#2466 Hammet...{02}{00}
#2467 {11}{03}, is that you?{02}{00}
#2468 These people... Are{03}they friends of yours?{02}{00}
#2469 Then it would appear your{03}journey has begun,{03}{11}{03}.{02}{00}
#246A I am a little late,{03}but I have come to{03}save you.{02}{00}
#246B You shouldn't have risked{03}yourself, {11}{03}.{02}{00}
#246C Hold it right there!{02}{00}
#246D Dodonpa!{02}{00}
#246E Sorry to interrupt your{03}teary little reunion,{03}Hammet!{02}{00}
#246F This must be your little{03}rat, {11}{03}{18}you always did{03}claim he'd rescue you!{02}{00}
#2470 Look at him.{03}He's just a child!{02}{00}
#2471 But to think these kids{03}could get this far!{02}{00}
#2472 Hey, yeah! If we're just{03}kids, what does that{03}make your pathetic thugs?{02}{00}
#2473 What kind of scum takes{03}ransom money and then{03}doesn't free his hostage?{02}{00}
#2474 I see. So, you've been{03}extorting money from{03}Layana, have you?{02}{00}
#2475 Now that we've found{03}Hammet, we'll be taking{03}him home!{02}{00}
#2476 I'm afraid I can't let{03}you do that.{02}{00}
#2477 Hammet is what I like to{03}call my little money{03}tree.{02}{00}
#2478 You dirty scoundrel!{02}{00}
#2479 Name-calling won't help{03}you! I'm not giving{03}Hammet up!{02}{00}
#247A Dodonpa pulled a lever.{02}{00}
#247B This little trap here{03}marks the end of your{03}good fortune!{02}{00}
#247C Prepare to become{03}monster fodder!{02}{00}
#247D Back for more? I guess{03}you didn't learn your{03}lesson!{02}{00}
#247E Dodonpa pulled a lever.{02}{00}
#247F Go ahead-keep trying!{03}You'll never win!{02}{00}
#2480 Prepare to become{03}monster fodder!{02}{00}
#2481 Uhnn! Get it off me!{02}{00}
#2482 How did Dodonpa get{03}trapped under the{03}monster?{02}{00}
#2483 He tried to pull{03}another dirty trick{03}on you!{02}{00}
#2484 When Dodonpa saw his{03}monster was losing, he{03}tried to get behind you.{02}{00}
#2485 Just a second longer, and{03}you'd have been history!{02}{00}
#2486 You dirty snake!{02}{00}
#2487 Dodonpa, you are{03}rotten to the core!{02}{00}
#2488 Yeah, OK! I'm {09}{02}sorry{07}!{03}Now, get this thing{03}off of me!{02}{00}
#2489 "Get this thing{03}off of me"!?{02}{00}
#248A I don't know. That thing{03}looks awfully heavy{03}for us kids to lift.{02}{00}
#248B What should we do,{03}{11}{01}? Should we try{03}to move it?{1E}{00}
#248C I agree.{01}What do you think,{03}Hammet?{02}{00}
#248D I think we have to{03}try, at least.{02}{00}
#248E There. You should be{03}able to get up now!{02}{00}
#248F I... I can't.{02}{00}
#2490 Did you break your{03}leg or something?{02}{00}
#2491 It's not broken...{05}{03}I should be able to{03}stand after a bit.{02}{00}
#2492 Thank goodness...{02}{00}
#2493 What do you mean,{03}"thank goodness"!?{02}{00}
#2494 Didn't he just{03}try to kill us?{02}{00}
#2495 Can't we just forgive{03}and forget?{02}{00}
#2496 Dodonpa kidnapped{03}you, remember!?{02}{00}
#2497 Oh, that's right...{02}{00}
#2498 Get a grip, you guys!{02}{00}
#2499 But Hammet is safe now,{03}isn't he?{02}{00}
#249A Yeah, but do you really{03}think Dodonpa will reform{03}if Hammet forgives him?{02}{00}
#249B Hmm... I wonder...{02}{00}
#249C How about it, Dodonpa?{02}{00}
#249D He already said{03}he wouldn't do anything!{02}{00}
#249E Of course, he's going{03}to say that! He wants{03}us to forgive him!{02}{00}
#249F What do you think we{03}should do with him,{03}{11}{02}?{02}{00}
#24A0 We should lock him up{03}here, just like he did{03}to Hammet.{02}{00}
#24A1 No! How can you{03}be so cruel!{02}{00}
#24A2 Oh? And yet you have{03}no problem being that{03}cruel to Hammet!{02}{00}
#24A3 What should we do,{03}{11}{01}? Should we{03}lock Dodonpa up?{1E}{00}
#24A4 Serves the little{03}punk right!{02}{00}
#24A5 Just leave him here{03}like this for a while!{02}{00}
#24A6 Dad!{02}{00}
#24A7 Dodonpa... You{05} pitiful{03}wretch.{02}{00}
#24A8 I always told you that{03}if you did evil to{03}others...{01}others would do evil{03}to you.{02}{00}
#24A9 You must right all of{03}the misdeeds you've{03}done!{02}{00}
#24AA I feel bad for spoiling{03}you. Look at the{03}trouble it has caused...{02}{00}
#24AB See! It's all your fault{03}that all this happened!{02}{00}
#24AC Yes, which is why this{03}is going to hurt you{03}more than it does me!{02}{00}
#24AD You're not serious,{03}are you, Dad?{02}{00}
#24AE I most certainly am!{02}{00}
#24AF You're going to spend some{03}time here thinking about{03}all that you've done!{02}{00}
#24B0 Dodonpa has caused you{03}all sorts of trouble,{03}hasn't he?{02}{00}
#24B1 No, not at all!{02}{00}
#24B2 I must apologize deeply{03}for all of this.{02}{00}
#24B3 Thank you, Donpa,{03}but you do not{03}need to apologize.{02}{00}
#24B4 Then you{05} forgive me?{02}{00}
#24B5 I am sorry about the{03}trouble, but I do have{03}one request.{02}{00}
#24B6 A request?{02}{00}
#24B7 I don't know how you{03}got in here, but please{03}leave by the same means.{02}{00}
#24B8 Huh? Donpa, didn't you{03}just say you're going{03}to lock up Dodonpa?{02}{00}
#24B9 So we shouldn't{03}have to sneak around,{03}should we?{02}{00}
#24BA Some of Dodonpa's{03}henchmen are still{03}loyal to him.{02}{00}
#24BB I'm ashamed to say it,{03}but they won't listen{03}to any of my orders.{02}{00}
#24BC This new gang of thieves{03}will attack Hammet if they{03}find him in the fortress.{02}{00}
#24BD And they may come to{03}check his cell, right?{02}{00}
#24BE I see. Then they'd free{03}Dodonpa, wouldn't they?{02}{00}
#24BF And then he'd head{03}straight for Kalay{03}seeking his revenge!{02}{00}
#24C0 I see. Yes, you're{03}right.{02}{00}
#24C1 It would be terrible{03}if Kalay were attacked.{02}{00}
#24C2 That's why you must{03}go while you still{03}can!{02}{00}
#24C3 You mean immediately?{02}{00}
#24C4 I heard of your intrusion,{03}so I spread some rumors{03}through the fortress.{02}{00}
#24C5 Rumors?{02}{00}
#24C6 I said brigands had snuck{03}in to kidnap Hammet, but{03}failed and ran off.{02}{00}
#24C7 Why in the world did{03}you do that?{02}{00}
#24C8 Now, they won't let{03}anyone down here{03}at all.{01}Plus, many of Dodonpa's{03}men have left to find{03}the intruders.{02}{00}
#24C9 Donpa, you are a{03}shrewd one!{02}{00}
#24CA I just thought I'd{03}try to help however{03}I could...{02}{00}
#24CB With Dodonpa's henchmen{03}gone, this is our{03}chance to escape, right?{1E}{00}
#24CC Why did I even bother{03}asking? Let's get{03}a move on!{02}{00}
#24CD The next time you meet{03}Dodonpa, he will be a{03}changed man.{02}{00}
#24CE I get it already! I{03}won't do anything wrong!{03}Come on, let me go!{02}{00}
#24CF {11}{01}! Don't be stupid!{03}We can't go in there,{03}remember?{02}{00}
#24D0 A large contingent of{03}Dodonpa's henchmen have{03}left the fortress.{02}{00}
#24D1 It's gotten colder...{03}I'm shiverin' just{03}standin' here.{02}{00}
#24D2 They say there were{03}intruders in the{03}fortress.{01}Just daring to try{03}such a thing is{03}impressive!{02}{00}
#24D3 Do you want to know what{03}caused the commotion{03}at the fortress?{1E}{00}
#24D4 Someone snuck into the{03}fortress to save the{03}merchant Hammet!{01}In the end, they{03}failed, so they just{03}ran away.{02}{00}
#24D5 They're foolhardy to{03}invade such a well-{03}guarded fortress!{01}But it would be pretty{03}neat if they got away{03}with it.{02}{00}
#24D6 Dodonpa's henchmen have{03}gotten their share{03}of bumps and bruises!{01}They've been acting{03}real tough, lately, but{03}they're nothing special.{02}{00}
#24D7 Apparently, Donpa told{03}Dodonpa's henchmen{03}about the intruders.{01}I guess when it comes{03}right down to it, Donpa{03}is on Dodonpa's side.{02}{00}
#24D8 They say that Dodonpa's{03}henchmen were defeated.{01}Hearing that makes me{03}feel like all my problems{03}have washed away!{02}{00}
#24D9 The fortress was under{03}strict guard.{01}Just who were those{03}people that snuck{03}inside?{02}{00}
#24DA Don't come any closer{03}to the fortress!{02}{00}
#24DB I've seen that man{03}with you before.{02}{00}
#24DC Nah, that's impossible.{03}I must be thinking of{03}somebody else.{02}{00}
#24DD How did the warriors{03}from Kalay get into{03}the fortress?{01}Man, did we get in{03}trouble for that!{02}{00}
#24DE I'm sure I've seen{03}that man with them{03}before!{02}{00}
#24DF I wonder what Dodonpa's{03}henchmen are up to?{02}{00}
#24E0 Look how far winter{03}has come already!{02}{00}
#24E1 Whoever snuck into the{03}fortress is in for some{03}trouble. Poor guys.{02}{00}
#24E2 I'm amazed anyone could{03}sneak into such a well-{03}guarded fortress!{02}{00}
#24E3 It's really funny to see{03}Dodonpa's henchmen{03}in such a panic!{02}{00}
#24E4 No matter how evil he is,{03}he's still Donpa's son.{01}I guess Donpa would{03}still do anything for{03}Dodonpa, huh?{02}{00}
#24E5 I was so mad when{03}Dodonpa's thugs took my{03}candy away.{02}{00}
#24E6 That is the only way into{03}or out of the fortress.{01}I don't see how anyone{03}could get in there{03}without being seen.{02}{00}
#24E7 Hmmm. That guy who's{03}following them sure{03}looks like that merchant.{01}But I only caught a{03}glimpse of him, so{03}I'm not real sure.{02}{00}
#24E8 I don't get it. We were{03}on guard the whole time!{03}Nobody got by us!{02}{00}
#24E9 Apparently, a traveling{03}merchant stopped by on{03}business recently.{01}He wasn't allowed{03}into the village,{03}of course.{02}{00}
#24EA The merchant who comes{03}every winter was the{03}one arguing at the gate.{01}Sigh. I'd like to buy{03}something, but no one's{03}allowed into the village!{02}{00}
#24EB That poor merchant.{03}They won't let him into{03}the village now.{02}{00}
#24EC That's one stubborn{03}merchant.{01}He's still hanging{03}around the outskirts{03}of town.{02}{00}
#24ED I saw a strange,{03}shimmering creature go{03}into the fortress.{01}Do you know{03}what it was?{02}{00}
#24EE I don't care what they{03}say, I don't believe it!{01}A shimmering creature{03}going into the{03}fortress!?{02}{00}
#24EF Could that shimmering{03}beast be the cause{03}of all the commotion?{02}{00}
#24F0 Monsters hardly ever{03}come into town.{01}Now, they expect me to{03}believe one snuck into{03}the fortress?{02}{00}
#24F1 What!? The eruption of{03}Mt. Aleph released{03}hordes of monsters?{01}I get the feeling things{03}are going to get worse{03}before they get better.{02}{00}
#24F2 Gramps has been really{03}cryptic lately.{01}He told me Mt. Aleph's{03}eruption was an omen of{03}a great flood. I hate that!{02}{00}
#24F3 I heard hordes of{03}monsters appeared right{03}before the great flood.{01}I hope the recent{03}troubles aren't a sign{03}of another flood!{02}{00}
#24F4 Great floods don't{03}happen every day,{03}you know!{02}{00}
#24F5 The end is near! Doom is{03}upon us! To arms!{03}To arms!{01}Once they're gone, they're{03}gone, so buy 'em{03}while they last!{02}{00}
#24F6 All those weapons, but I{03}doubt Dodonpa's henchmen{03}can use them!{02}{00}
#24F7 What do you think?{03}I've got some incredible{03}products here, huh?{01}Buy whatever you like!{02}{00}
#24F8 Once I sell this armor,{03}I'm closing shop...{03}It's kind of a pity...{02}{00}
#24F9 The weapons and armor{03}vendors are looking{03}desperate.{01}The stuff they're{03}selling now is the last{03}of their stock.{02}{00}
#24FA It isn't just the weapons{03}vendors whose inventory{03}is falling!{01}We're almost out of{03}products too!{02}{00}
#24FB Do you want rest in{03}our inn?{1E}{00}
#24FC I see. In that case,{03}go ahead and stay.{03}I won't ask why.{02}{00}
#24FD Well, do as you like.{01}Feel free to stay here{03}anytime you like.{02}{00}
#24FE Are you Donpa's guest?{1E}{00}
#24FF So, you're the one we{03}were told to give the{03}royal treatment to!{01}Oh, you're supposed to{03}visit Donpa again once{03}the guests have left.{02}{00}
#2500 Really, you're not?{03}Well, then, who is Donpa's{03}guest?{02}{00}
#2501 What's with the boss?{01}He told me to air out the{03}guest-room bedding and{03}change the sheets.{02}{00}
#2502 I just gave the boss a{03}letter Dodonpa sent from{03}the fortress.{01}Now, suddenly, he wants me{03}to start cooking up a storm.{03}Are we expecting guests?{02}{00}
#2503 I guess some really{03}important guests of{03}Donpa's are coming.{01}All I know is five young{03}warriors are coming,{03}but I've never met them.{02}{00}
#2504 I can't imagine Donpa's{03}guests being anyone{03}but these folks.{01}If they don't show up,{03}all my work will have{03}been for nothing!{02}{00}
#2505 With the village closed,{03}I wonder if those guests{03}will even come.{02}{00}
#2506 I heard Donpa was sick,{03}but he seemed to be{03}in pretty good shape.{02}{00}
#2507 A number of Dodonpa's{03}men set out not too{03}long ago.{01}I wonder what sort of{03}evil deeds they'll{03}perpetrate this time.{02}{00}
#2508 Please strike down{03}Dodonpa's henchmen with{03}a bolt from the blue...{01}Oh no! I'm supposed to be{03}spreading good will,{01}but now I've gone and{03}cursed them.{02}{00}
#2509 Lunpa Fortress is a{03}mass of confusion{03}right now.{01}If you don't want to get{03}hurt, be off with{03}you! Be off now!{02}{00}
#250A They never let the{03}merchants come into{03}the village!{01}I don't know you guys{03}from Adam! You think I'm{03}going to let you in?{02}{00}
#250B These guys couldn't be{03}the ones that got into the{03}fortress, could they?{01}This lazy-looking{03}mug? No way!{02}{00}
#250C That merchant was{03}desperate to do{03}business in the village.{01}I'm sure he's around{03}somewhere, but I doubt{03}he's causin' any trouble!{02}{00}
#250D I think I saw someone{03}just now.{02}{00}
#250E Yeah. I saw{03}something, too.{02}{00}
#250F Do you think Dodonpa's{03}henchmen have found us?{1E}{00}
#2510 If they have, we'll have{03}to take care of them{03}right now!{02}{00}
#2511 Huh? You think there's{03}something else out there!?{02}{00}
#2512 Just a moment!{02}{00}
#2513 Is that you, Bunza?{02}{00}
#2514 Gasp! That voice!{02}{00}
#2515 It's Hammet!{02}{00}
#2516 So, Dodonpa never had{03}any intention of{03}releasing Hammet?{02}{00}
#2517 That's right. That's why{03}{11}{03} and his friends{03}came to the rescue!{02}{00}
#2518 Once {11}{01} made up his{03}mind, we all decided{03}to come save Hammet.{02}{00}
#2519 Hey, {11}{03}! Are you{03}saying this was all{03}{11}{01}'s idea?{02}{00}
#251A N-No! I mean, you and{03}{11}{04} helped us, too!{02}{00}
#251B Thank you, {11}{01},{03}{11}{02}, and {11}{04}.{02}{00}
#251C And, of course, you,{03}too, {11}{03}!{02}{00}
#251D You sure did a good{03}job finding this cave,{03}Bunza.{02}{00}
#251E Yes! Impressive work{03}you did, Bunza!{02}{00}
#251F It was pure{03}coincidence.{02}{00}
#2520 I really didn't want to{03}come to Lunpa.{02}{00}
#2521 Because we knew the{03}thieves had Hammet{03}imprisoned...{02}{00}
#2522 Then why did you come{03}here?{02}{00}
#2523 I recalled what Hammet{03}told me about being{03}a successful merchant.{02}{00}
#2524 Really? He told you{03}that you should start{03}trading in Lunpa?{02}{00}
#2525 No, I meant his more{03}general words of wisdom...{02}{00}
#2526 "Merchants must not{03}judge customers on their{03}appearances."{02}{00}
#2527 "Do not avoid a place{03}just because something{03}unpleasant may happen."{02}{00}
#2528 "As long as customers{03}await your goods,{01}you must do everything{03}in your power to sell{03}to them!"{02}{00}
#2529 So, you came to serve the{03}villagers, even though{03}you despised Dodonpa?{02}{00}
#252A Fate put this opportunity{03}before you.{02}{00}
#252B But why did you think a{03}Kalay merchant would be{03}permitted into Lunpa?{02}{00}
#252C I didn't. And, in fact,{03}they would not let me in.{02}{00}
#252D Yet, knowing that, you{03}still came?{02}{00}
#252E But you know what?{03}There was that huge{03}commotion, right?{02}{00}
#252F He must mean the{03}activity caused by{03}Donpa's rumors!{02}{00}
#2530 It all came together{03}for me... That commotion{03}was related to Hammet!{02}{00}
#2531 I had to find out what{03}was going on...{02}{00}
#2532 And that's how you{03}found this cave?{02}{00}
#2533 I'll bet you couldn't{03}find any way to get that{03}gate open from this side.{02}{00}
#2534 But then all of a sudden,{03}it moved, so I hid{03}behind a rock.{02}{00}
#2535 We startled you, didn't{03}we, Bunza?{02}{00}
#2536 I am just glad you{03}were able to get Hammet{03}out safely!{02}{00}
#2537 Why do you say it{03}like that, Bunza?{02}{00}
#2538 Dodonpa's henchmen have{03}been combing the area...{02}{00}
#2539 Even if they aren't after{03}Hammet, if they find him...{02}{00}
#253A They might capture{03}Hammet again! Let's get{03}out of here, quickly!{02}{00}
#253B But we have to escape{03}without being seen by{03}Dodonpa's henchmen...{02}{00}
#253C What should we do,{03}{11}{01}? Should we{03}stay and fight?{1E}{00}
#253D Saving Hammet from that{03}fortress was dangerous{03}enough...{02}{00}
#253E Taking them all on is{03}more foolhardy than{03}invading their fortress.{02}{00}
#253F Then what should we{03}do, Bunza?{02}{00}
#2540 I have a wagon nearby.{02}{00}
#2541 A wagon?{02}{00}
#2542 That's right. Let's all{03}go back to Kalay in my{03}wagon.{02}{00}
#2543 Won't a wagon stand out?{03}If it were searched by{03}Dodonpa's henchmen...{02}{00}
#2544 There's no need to worry.{03}I've been here since{03}before the commotion.{02}{00}
#2545 Right. They've already{03}seen your wagon around...{02}{00}
#2546 That's correct, {11}{02}.{03}They don't suspect me{03}of being involved!{02}{00}
#2547 Then let's take that{03}wagon to Kalay!{02}{00}
#2548 Should we ride in the{03}wagon, too?{1E}{00}
#2549 Huh? You don't want to{03}ride in Bunza's wagon?{1E}{00}
#254A So, what? You've changed{03}your mind? You do want{03}to go with them?{1E}{00}
#254B Now I'm totally confused.{03}You changed your mind{03}again?{02}{00}
#254C Stop wasting our time!{03}Are we riding in the{03}wagon?{1E}{00}
#254D Do you have some{03}unfinished business{03}in Lunpa?{1E}{00}
#254E If you insist, then I'll{03}stick with you!{02}{00}
#254F Hey... I can't leave you{03}two here by yourselves!{03}I'll stay behind, too.{02}{00}
#2550 Hammet, I'm going to go{03}with {11}{01}, too.{02}{00}
#2551 Yes, {11}{03}, you should{03}accompany your friends{03}on this mission.{02}{00}
#2552 I'm disappointed we can't{03}travel home together,{03}but I understand.{01}Be careful, {11}{03}!{02}{00}
#2553 Sigh. They've gone!{02}{00}
#2554 I hope Hammet and Bunza{03}make it to Kalay safely.{02}{00}
#2555 They'll be okay. I'm{03}sure they'll make it{03}there in one piece.{02}{00}
#2556 Well. Let's get going{03}ourselves, {11}{01}!{03}We're off!{02}{00}
#2557 Do you have any{03}unfinished business?{1E}{00}
#2558 If you don't have any{03}unfinished business, then{03}let's get on to Kalay!{02}{00}
#2559 Lady Layana will be{03}so happy, won't she?{02}{00}
#255A Yes. I'd like to see{03}her as soon as{03}possible.{02}{00}
#255B Then, let's set off!{02}{00}
#255C Are you saying you still{03}have some things to do{03}here in Lunpa? {1E}{00}
#255D Don't startle me! You{03}don't have anything{03}left to do, do you? {1E}{00}
#255E Meaning...you won't ride{03}in the wagon?{02}{00}
#255F I am sorry, {11}{01}, but{03}I cannot safely wait{03}here any longer.{02}{00}
#2560 So...do you intend{03}to stay and finish{03}your business?{1E}{00}
#2561 Thank you for your help{03}with Dodonpa.{02}{00}
#2562 I have a little something{03}for you, for your teaching{03}Dodonpa his lesson.{02}{00}
#2563 Give these people a{03}token of my gratitude.{02}{00}
#2564 Deep within there is an{03}interesting creature that{03}I fought once long ago.{02}{00}
#2565 I give this to you.{03}Please take good care{03}of it.{02}{00}
#2566 Donpa is very grateful{03}for what you have{03}done.{02}{00}
#2567 Well, now I'm worried{03}about Dodonpa really{03}turning over a new leaf!{02}{00}
#2568 It must be difficult{03}for Donpa right now.{01}It's so hard to teach{03}a child a lesson.{02}{00}
#2569 What father can stay{03}angry at his children{03}for long?{01}Actually, I'd like to{03}free Dodonpa from his{03}cell right now.{02}{00}
#256A The merchant from Kalay{03}is in here somewhere.{03}He's not going anywhere.{02}{00}
#256B Actually, Dodonpa's in{03}here, but only a few{03}people know that.{01}As long as we're on{03}guard, no one will find{03}out.{02}{00}
#256C I was wrong! I'll turn{03}over a new leaf, Dad!{03}Please forgive me!{02}{00}
#256D I can't believe what you{03}did to me! When I get out{03}of here,{05} I'll get you all!{02}{00}
#256E The key doesn't work.{03}Maybe Donpa changed{03}the locks.{02}{00}
#256F We've arrived, Hammet.{02}{00}
#2570 Arrived where?{02}{00}
#2571 Oh, didn't I tell you about{03}this entrance, {11}{03}?{02}{00}
#2572 This underground passage{03}leads to Hammet Palace.{02}{00}
#2573 An{05} underground{05} passage?{05}{03}What for?{02}{00}
#2574 Just to be safe.{02}{00}
#2575 I don't understand.{03}Why bring the wagon in{03}this way?{02}{00}
#2576 Because Dodonpa's{03}henchmen may be{03}here in Kalay...{02}{00}
#2577 Well then, Bunza, would{03}you please take them{03}to the town's entrance?{02}{00}
#2578 What?{05} Why? We'll just go{03}this way with you.{02}{00}
#2579 You can't. You must go{03}through town to the{03}Palace.{02}{00}
#257A I'm confused...{02}{00}
#257B You have no reason to{03}hide, now, do you?{02}{00}
#257C Why shouldn't we just{03}go in this way?{02}{00}
#257D That would raise{03}suspicions.{02}{00}
#257E Wouldn't it be strange if{03}people who aren't even{03}supposed to be in town...{01}suddenly walked out{03}of the Palace?{02}{00}
#257F If anyone noticed, they{03}might learn of this{03}secret entrance.{02}{00}
#2580 Now, do you understand?{1E}{00}
#2581 In that case how{03}about this?{02}{00}
#2582 I think Hammet and Lady{03}Layana need time for{03}their reunion...{02}{00}
#2583 In that case, we will{03}gladly ride in the wagon.{02}{00}
#2584 Do you want to go to{03}the cave up ahead?{1E}{00}
#2585 I'd like to let you go, but{03}I cannot. You'd better{03}just turn around.{02}{00}
#2586 Good, because I wouldn't{03}be able to let you{03}anyway.{02}{00}
#2587 Hammet and Lady Layana{03}have commanded that none{03}shall pass through here.{02}{00}
#2588 So! {05} It's {11}{03} and{03}his companions...{03}Perfect timing!{02}{00}
#2589 So{05}, it's you...{02}{00}
#258A I told you time and time{03}again not to go to Lunpa,{03}but you went anyway.{02}{00}
#258B Please, Layana, don't be{03}so harsh on them.{02}{00}
#258C Naturally, I'm happy{03}that they rescued you.{02}{00}
#258D But this was something{03}that Kalay should have{03}handled alone.{02}{00}
#258E You had a more pressing{03}quest at hand, no?{1E}{00}
#258F Yes.{05} Your mission is to{03}recover the Elemental{03}Stars.{02}{00}
#2590 Have you completely{03}forgotten your own{03}quest!?{02}{00}
#2591 Layana,{05} you shouldn't...{02}{00}
#2592 I...{05} I had to rescue{03}Hammet,{05} no matter{03}the cost...{02}{00}
#2593 It's already done.{03}There is nothing{03}more to be said.{02}{00}
#2594 Hold on! We all wanted{03}to save Hammet as badly{03}as {11}{03} did.{02}{00}
#2595 It doesn't matter,{03}{11}{02}. I'm the one{03}at fault!{02}{00}
#2596 I made a mistake.{03}We will leave immediately{03}on {11}{05}'s trail!{02}{00}
#2597 Yes. That would be best.{03}Leave immediately.{02}{00}
#2598 {11}{01}, we should be{03}going.{02}{00}
#2599 {11}{03}, is that really{03}what you want?{02}{00}
#259A Well, if {11}{03} says so...{03}Should we go,{03}{11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#259B If both {11}{01} and{03}{11}{03} want to leave,{03}then I guess that's it.{02}{00}
#259C Take your Shaman's Rod{03}and go to Hesperia.{02}{00}
#259D To Hesperia...?{02}{00}
#259E That is what the Jupiter{03}Adept said.{02}{00}
#259F Hesperia...{03}Where is that?{02}{00}
#25A0 It is the continent{03}to the west of{03}Angara.{02}{00}
#25A1 What are we going to{03}find in Hesperia if{03}we go?{02}{00}
#25A2 That, I do not know...{02}{00}
#25A3 The continent to the{03}west? On the other side{03}of the sea?{02}{00}
#25A4 Do not waste time{03}chattering. You must set{03}out immediately.{02}{00}
#25A5 Take your Shaman's Rod{03}and set out for{03}Hesperia.{01}And...{05}be careful.{02}{00}
#25A6 No one in Kalay knows{03}Hammet has returned.{01}We will have to hide{03}Hammet in the Palace for{03}quite a while.{02}{00}
#25A7 I hear Hammet was saved{03}by you people...{03}Thank you so much!{02}{00}
#25A8 They say Hammet's return{03}is supposed to be{03}a secret for now.{01}The villagers are worried,{03}so I'd like to tell them,{03}but we can't...{02}{00}
#25A9 I left the door to the{03}underground passage{03}open, so go have a look.{02}{00}
#25AA I wonder if any of{03}Dodonpa's thugs{05} have come{03}here after Hammet...{01}That is the only thing{03}that really has me{03}frightened.{02}{00}
#25AB The secret passage is{03}locked because Hammet's{03}treasure is in there.{02}{00}
#25AC Layana's words pain her{03}more than they can know.{01}Surely, {11}{01} and{03}his friends understand{03}Layana's feelings.{02}{00}
#25AD I'm so happy Hammet made{03}it back safely, I could{03}cry...{01}{11}{01}, {11}{03}...{03}We all must thank you.{02}{00}
#25AE I'm so relieved Hammet{03}made it back safely.{02}{00}
#25AF I can't let on to the{03}townspeople when I{03}speak to them!{02}{00}
#25B0 Layana ordered the door{03}to the underground{03}path opened.{01}This represents our{03}gratitude toward {11}{01}{03}and his friends{01}...for saving Hammet.{02}{00}
#25B1 We will never let{03}Dodonpa's henchmen get{03}Hammet again...{02}{00}
#25B2 The key to the secret{03}passage is also the key to{03}Hammet's treasure room.{02}{00}
#25B3 Layana was very hard{03}on all of you, wasn't{03}she?{1E}{00}
#25B4 I think she went too{03}far, telling you all{03}to leave...{01}But she is the one who{03}most regrets parting{03}with {11}{03}.{02}{00}
#25B5 Her words were hard,{03}but you know how painful{03}they were for her to say.{01}Layana will be very{03}happy to hear that.{02}{00}
#25B6 The things beyond these{03}doors belong to you all.{03}Please take them!{02}{00}
#25B7 This is Suhalla.{01}Don't try crossing the{03}desert. The sandstorms{03}are too fierce.{02}{00}
#25B8 Are you trying to get{03}to Lalivero?{1E}{00}
#25B9 Making it through the{03}sandstorms is impossible.{03}Don't bother.{02}{00}
#25BA Didn't you come from{03}Angara?{01}Anytime Angarans come{03}to Suhalla, they're always{03}going to Lalivero.{02}{00}
#25BB We Gondowans will never{03}trust anyone from{03}Angara! You know why?{01}{11}{07}, the holy child of{03}Lalivero, was taken away{03}as a hostage to Tolbi.{02}{00}
#25BC It has been said for ages{03}that desert spirits only{03}create sandstorms...{01}when they are angry.{02}{00}
#25BD You can't get to southern{03}Gondowan from here,{03}can you?{01}There are many natural{03}obstacles. There is no{03}way to cross them.{02}{00}
#25BE The workers say there're{03}huge festivals in Tolbi.{03}I'd like to see one.{02}{00}
#25BF The sandstorms suddenly{03}increased...{01}I hope no one gets{03}caught in one and{03}gets injured.{02}{00}
#25C0 The Suhalla has long been{03}known for its sandstorms.{03}There are too many now.{02}{00}
#25C1 The people of Lalivero{03}have been worked hard by{03}Angara's soldiers.{01}No one would dare make{03}Suhallans work like that!{02}{00}
#25C2 The ruler of Tolbi took a{03}girl named {11}{07} hostage{03}to control Lalivero.{01}We'll never trust{03}anyone from Angara!{02}{00}
#25C3 I know the desert spirits{03}will exact their vengeance{03}on Babi for this.{02}{00}
#25C4 Southern Gondowan is{03}guarded by the{03}natural terrain.{01}We are constantly{03}worried about an{03}invasion from Angara...{02}{00}
#25C5 I've heard that Tolbi's{03}Colosso is a{03}warriors' festival, but...{01}I wonder what a{03}warriors' festival{03}is like...{02}{00}
#25C6 None of the grown-ups in{03}Suhalla go into the desert{03}during a sandstorm.{02}{00}
#25C7 My father loves people{03}so much, he can't help but{03}aid anyone in trouble.{01}But I love my father{03}despite his faults.{02}{00}
#25C8 Let me know if you{03}have any problems.{01}I'll do anything I{03}can to help.{02}{00}
#25C9 When I see people in{03}trouble, I just can't{03}sit still.{01}I guess I'm just{03}my father's child!{02}{00}
#25CA I want to help people{03}so badly, I can't sit{03}idly by!{02}{00}
#25CB Tolbi probably ignores{03}small villages like{03}Suhalla, doesn't it?{01}Now that I think about{03}it, that's probably for{03}the best.{02}{00}
#25CC If you head east across{03}Suhalla, Lalivero is{03}so close you can see it{01}across the Nol River, but{03}you can't get across the{03}river delta.{02}{00}
#25CD Suhalla is a desert{03}village. I guess it will{03}never be like Lalivero.{02}{00}
#25CE Good thing it's not easy{03}to get to Lalivero!{01}If it were, Suhalla would{03}be completely{03}left behind.{02}{00}
#25CF Ours is the only store{03}in Suhalla.{01}This is a small village,{03}so one store is enough.{02}{00}
#25D0 A village this small{03}can't support many{03}shops.{02}{00}
#25D1 Sigh. Nothin' to do...{01}Maybe we'll see business{03}once Tolbi's festival{03}ends.{02}{00}
#25D2 I wonder if any customers{03}can get through those{03}sandstorms...{01}First, they'd have to{03}want to cross through{03}the desert.{02}{00}
#25D3 Once the festival ends,{03}the travelers will head{03}for Lalivero.{01}If they just get caught{03}in the sandstorms, they'll{03}be my customers!{02}{00}
#25D4 For some reason, anyone{03}who gets caught in a{03}sandstorm winds up here.{01}They all give up trying{03}to cross the desert and{03}take shelter in Suhalla.{02}{00}
#25D5 I get sick thinking about{03}Lalivero being under{03}Tolbi's rule.{02}{00}
#25D6 The holy child, {11}{07},{03}will save those deluded{03}Laliverans.{01}That is what they{03}believe in Lalivero.{02}{00}
#25D7 Welcome to Suhalla. I{03}bet the sandstorms{03}were terrible...{02}{00}
#25D8 The desert is enveloped{03}in sandstorms! It's{03}frightening!{02}{00}
#25D9 Soldiers from Tolbi were{03}caught in the sandstorms,{03}and nearly all perished!{01}The survivors are in{03}that house.{02}{00}
#25DA We were brought here{03}by the sandstorms. It{03}all happened so fast!{02}{00}
#25DB This sandstorm is the{03}fault of the Angarans!{01}If you all hadn't built that{03}thing in Lalivero, the{03}spirits wouldn't be angry!{02}{00}
#25DC You were brought to{03}Suhalla by the{03}sandstorm, right?{1E}{00}
#25DD Everyone who gets caught{03}in the sandstorms winds{03}up in Suhalla.{01}You should be glad you{03}weren't blown away to{03}some strange place!{02}{00}
#25DE I don't care what anyone{03}says, there shouldn't{03}be so many sandstorms!{01}What in the world{03}could be going on in{03}the Suhalla desert?{02}{00}
#25DF Why are the sandstorms{03}attacking humans?{01}It's as if the{03}sandstorms are{03}actually alive!{02}{00}
#25E0 Those soldiers kept{03}mumbling about monsters...{02}{00}
#25E1 I bet these warriors{03}were brought here by a{03}sandstorm.{02}{00}
#25E2 I wonder why there{03}are so many sandstorms?{01}It wasn't this bad{05}{03}until only recently.{02}{00}
#25E3 The soldiers from Tolbi{03}were collapsing, like{03}after a battle.{02}{00}
#25E4 After you get swallowed{03}by a sandstorm, you{03}have a few moments{01}before you get blown back{03}here, but still there's{03}nothing you can do...{02}{00}
#25E5 Lately, all the sandstorms{03}have been incredibly{03}fierce.{01}What could the desert{03}spirits be so angry{03}about?{02}{00}
#25E6 If you fight the storms,{03}you'll enrage the spirits,{03}and they'll take your life.{01}I bet that's what{03}happened to the{03}soldiers from Tolbi.{02}{00}
#25E7 Grown-ups say the{03}sandstorms attack people.{01}But, it doesn't make{03}sense that a storm would{03}attack anything!{02}{00}
#25E8 They say the soldiers{03}were ravaged by a{03}sandstorm...{01}but I think it must{03}have been a monster...{02}{00}
#25E9 The wounded are sleeping,{03}so don't raise your{03}voice!{02}{00}
#25EA I am amazed these{03}soldiers survived their{03}wounds...{01}They must have been{03}in good shape!{02}{00}
#25EB Iodem...{02}{00}
#25EC You soldiers were{03}supposed to be heading{03}for Babi Lighthouse!{02}{00}
#25ED Iodem... What are{03}you doing here?{02}{00}
#25EE Babi ordered me to go to{03}the lighthouse with{03}{11}{01}.{02}{00}
#25EF You were escorting {11}{07}{03}to Lalivero, no?{02}{00}
#25F0 We've disgraced Tolbi...{02}{00}
#25F1 What has happened to{03}{11}{07}? Where is {11}{07}!?{02}{00}
#25F2 I don't know. When we{03}awoke, we were here in{03}these beds.{02}{00}
#25F3 If anything has happened{03}to {11}{07}, what will{03}become of the lighthouse?{02}{00}
#25F4 {11}{07} was the sole{03}reason Lalivero aided{03}us in its construction.{02}{00}
#25F5 We entrusted you with{03}{11}{07} to speed up the{03}construction.{01}Was that a mistake?{02}{00}
#25F6 Iodem...{05} I know that, at{03}the very least, {11}{07}{03}wasn't in the sandstorm.{02}{00}
#25F7 Is this true!?{02}{00}
#25F8 {11}{07} was entrusted to{03}our care, so we shielded{03}her from any risk.{02}{00}
#25F9 You acted properly,{03}then, but where is{03}{11}{07} now?{02}{00}
#25FA Probably not far from the{03}edge of the sandstorm{03}that hit us...{02}{00}
#25FB {11}{01}, we must go to{03}the desert and find{03}{11}{07}.{02}{00}
#25FC If you're going to the{03}desert...beware of{03}that cyclone!{02}{00}
#25FD At first{05}, we couldn't{03}avoid getting caught{03}in the sandstorms.{02}{00}
#25FE But there were others{03}who were able to make it{03}through the storms.{02}{00}
#25FF Who knows how they got{03}it, but they used water{03}to stop the cyclones.{02}{00}
#2600 Water? You can stop the{03}sandstorms with water...{02}{00}
#2601 I think I understand.{03}Now get some rest...{02}{00}
#2602 Wait, Iodem...{05} There is{03}more. You must not meet{03}our fate...{02}{00}
#2603 The sandstorms{05} are{03}caused{05} by monsters.{02}{00}
#2604 Can this be?{02}{00}
#2605 The others...{05} They slayed{03}the beasts{05}... That's{03}how they got through.{02}{00}
#2606 Wh{05}-Who{05}{18}what are they?{02}{00}
#2607 When the storms stopped,{03}they would move ahead,{03}{05}but a new storm always...{02}{00}
#2608 They had strange powers.{03}We had to bring barrels{05}{03}filled with water...{02}{00}
#2609 But carrying the barrels{03}exhausted us...and then{05}{03}the beast...{02}{00}
#260A That's enough...{03}Get some rest!{02}{00}
#260B They are dangerous, those{03}others. Slay that beast{03}and take up the trail...{02}{00}
#260C Thank you for your help.{03}You have dispatched your{03}duties with honor.{02}{00}
#260D Could these others be{03}the ones you are{03}following, {11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#260E You took the same{03}impression from their{03}tale as I did...{02}{00}
#260F I don't know why...{03}but that is the sense{03}I get from this tale...{02}{00}
#2610 We must find {11}{07} as{03}quickly as we can!{02}{00}
#2611 Then, we shall get through{03}the Suhalla and pursue{03}your opponents.{02}{00}
#2612 Why were they headed{03}toward eastern{03}Gondowan?{01}I have a bad feeling about{03}this. Please! You must{03}overtake them...{02}{00}
#2613 Where is {11}{07}...{03}What has happened{03}to {11}{07}?{02}{00}
#2614 These old soldiers must{03}rest until their wounds{03}heal.{02}{00}
#2615 Who could have done{03}this to such powerful{03}soldiers?{02}{00}
#2616 A column of water shot{03}up when they were caught{03}in the sandstorm.{01}Then the sand was gone.{01}But it was so much more{03}water than we could ever{03}hold in our barrels...{02}{00}
#2617 {11}{07} was not far{03}behind us. She should{03}still be safe.{01}{11}{07} must be in the{03}desert somewhere...{03}If not, maybe they...{02}{00}
#2618 Do not approach the{03}large cyclones in the{03}middle of the Suhalla.{01}The Suhallans call those{03}death storms. They are{03}pure evil.{02}{00}
#2619 Death storms, huh?{03}There was a saying about{03}those big cyclones...{01}Ummm, What...{03}What was it?{03}...I can't remember.{02}{00}
#261A Once you get swept up in{03}a death storm, you can{03}never be rescued.{01}Countless people are{03}missing because of{03}them.{02}{00}
#261B "Ye who seek..."{03}Something about eyes of{03}truth... What was it?{01}"When ye take thy{03}treasure, a creature of{03}darkness..."{01}Oh, fiddle-faddle.{03}I forget.{02}{00}
#261C Aren't you surprised{03}to find so few shops?{1E}{00}
#261D I bet you are! Suhalla{03}is a small village...{03}Ours is the only shop!{01}We don't have anything{03}great, but feel free to{03}look around.{02}{00}
#261E It's really something{03}to have an equipment{03}shop...{02}{00}
#261F We've had more customers{03}lately because of the{03}increase in sandstorms.{02}{00}
#2620 We've been busy ever{03}since the surge of{03}sandstorms!{01}We are happy about it,{03}but we feel bad for{03}the poor travelers.{02}{00}
#2621 It will take time for the{03}storms to die down, so{03}make yourselves at home.{02}{00}
#2622 We went into the Suhalla{03}to go build the lighthouse,{03}but the storms caught us.{01}Sigh. Now we can't{03}reach Babi Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#2623 The sandstorms are so{03}bad, we've given up trying{03}to reach Babi Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#2624 I suppose you folk were{03}blown here on your way{03}to Babi Lighthouse?{1E}{00}
#2625 If you follow the northern{03}mountain, you can get{03}back to Tolbi.{01}I'm giving up, too...{03}Let's head back{03}that way.{02}{00}
#2626 I set out for Babi{03}Lighthouse to open{03}a business there,{01}but then I was blown{03}back here again!{02}{00}
#2627 The sandstorms are{03}sending customers our{03}way!{01}I hope those winds keep{03}right on blowing!{02}{00}
#2628 Please, great sandstorms!{03}Send us more{03}customers!{02}{00}
#2629 Even if we can't go, it{03}won't affect construction{03}of the lighthouse much.{02}{00}
#262A So, shall we give up on{03}Babi Lighthouse and{03}head back to Tolbi?{02}{00}
#262B When that cyclone threw{03}us into the air, I thought{03}we were done for!{01}I'm happy just to be{03}alive!{02}{00}
#262C I wonder why we're{03}having all these{03}sandstorms...{02}{00}
#262D I shudder to think{03}sandstorms will get{03}me if I leave town.{02}{00}
#262E A sandstorm!{02}{00}
#262F There'll be trouble{03}if we get caught up{03}in one of those...{02}{00}
#2630 But something is wrong...{03}Why are there so many?{02}{00}
#2631 If we don't get past{03}here, we'll never make{03}it to Babi Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#2632 We must step carefully{03}if we hope to escape{03}the desert.{02}{00}
#2633 {11}{07} is nowhere to{03}be found.{02}{00}
#2634 I wonder what{03}happened...{02}{00}
#2635 Should we search the{03}desert once more or{03}press on to Lalivero?{02}{00}
#2636 What do you say, {11}{01}?{03}Should we keep going?{1E}{00}
#2637 Ah, yes. I had forgotten{03}about your foes...{02}{00}
#2638 But I must carry out{03}Babi's orders...{02}{00}
#2639 Our guard gate{03}lies ahead.{02}{00}
#263A We can leave {11}{07} to{03}the soldiers at the{03}gate.{02}{00}
#263B Well, perhaps we should{03}head there first, then.{02}{00}
#263C Look at this!{02}{00}
#263D What happened?{02}{00}
#263E Babi's ship...{02}{00}
#263F Hm... Perhaps it{03}is time...{02}{00}
#2640 {11}{01}{05}, take this...{03}Try to use it.{02}{00}
#2641 You got the Black Orb.{02}{00}
#2642 Now use it...{03}on the ship.{02}{00}
#2643 {11}{01}, where you going?{03}I said to use the Orb{03}on Babi's ship!{02}{00}
#2644 What's the matter?{02}{00}
#2645 Strange... Nothing{03}happened. What does{03}it mean?{02}{00}
#2646 Could Babi{05} have{03}been wrong?{02}{00}
#2647 No. Not Babi...{02}{00}
#2648 I was wrong{18}it is{03}not yet time.{01}We must press on to{03}Babi Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#2649 I will take that back{05},{03}for now.{02}{00}
#264A You returned the{03}Black Orb.{02}{00}
#264B We will return to{03}the ship later.{02}{00}
#264C The wreckage of a ship{03}scuttled off the coast.{02}{00}
#264D Only those with travel{03}papers may pass through.{01}If you do not have them{03}you must turn back{03}at once.{02}{00}
#264E Do you want to go to{03}Babi Lighthouse?{1E}{00}
#264F Show me your travel{03}papers, and I'll let{03}you pass!{02}{00}
#2650 What! You don't have{03}travel papers? Then I{03}cannot let you pass!{02}{00}
#2651 Hmmph!{05} You don't want{03}to see Babi Lighthouse?{03}You're a strange one!{02}{00}
#2652 I never ask why I{03}must protect this{03}place!{01}I simply obey Babi's{03}orders...{02}{00}
#2653 I wonder if this year's{03}Colosso is over yet...{01}Sigh. I'd like to see{03}Colosso next year...{02}{00}
#2654 What is the meaning{03}of this!?{02}{00}
#2655 Uh! {05}Is...{05}{03}Is that Iodem...?{02}{00}
#2656 What has happened{03}to the gate?{02}{00}
#2657 There was a strange{03}group... No papers...{03}They wanted to pass...{02}{00}
#2658 Uhh... Io{05}dem...{02}{00}
#2659 We tried to hold them{03}back...{05}but they were{03}too powerful!{02}{00}
#265A They{05} had strange{03}powers...{05} We were{03}no match for them.{02}{00}
#265B It must have been {11}{05}!{1E}{00}
#265C Yeah... No one else{03}is capable of this.{02}{00}
#265D Don't you know the work{03}of your own foe's hand?{03}Who else could it be?{02}{00}
#265E After we find {11}{07},{03}we must track down the{03}monsters that did this.{02}{00}
#265F We must get to Babi{03}Lighthouse as soon as{03}possible!{02}{00}
#2660 Yes{05}, but we cannot{03}leave the soldiers{03}like this...{02}{00}
#2661 We're okay.{05} Don't worry{03}about us! Get after{03}them{05}, please...{02}{00}
#2662 But that would be...{02}{00}
#2663 We were bested in{03}battle, but we will{05}{03}survive...{05} Now go!{02}{00}
#2664 If they have done anything{03}at the lighthouse...{03}It would be our...{02}{00}
#2665 He's right. We've got{03}to stop them!{02}{00}
#2666 We're going after them,{03}right, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#2667 Ohhh!{05} It's no use...{03}I don't think I can{03}get up.{01}Send help once you{03}reach Babi Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#2668 It's a pity a Colosso{03}victor should end up{03}like this...{01}Next time I see them,{03}I'll be sure to settle{03}the score!{02}{00}
#2669 Curses! It's a disgrace{03}to be seen by Iodem{03}like this...{01}I'd rather crawl into{03}a hole and hide.{02}{00}
#266A I thought I was dead!{03}I'm lucky even to be alive{03}right now...{01}The strange ones with the{03}wild hair... Their power{03}was too much for us.{02}{00}
#266B I have been traveling{03}the lands spreading{03}good will.{02}{00}
#266C Cliffs, deserts...{03}Gondowan is a desolate{03}wasteland.{02}{00}
#266D Venus Lighthouse was...{05}{03}attacked by{05} strange...{05}{05}{03}wanderers...{02}{00}
#266E Iodem, be{05} happy. The{03}entrance to Venus{03}Lighthouse is open...{01}After{05} years of study...{03}our dreams have{05} at{03}last come{05} true!{02}{00}
#266F Ohhh! How could they{03}attack mere scholars?{03}Those barbarians!{02}{00}
#2670 I've waited so long to see{03}what it's like inside Venus{03}Lighthouse, but...{02}{00}
#2671 I can't even move{03}without feeling terrible,{03}terrible pain.{02}{00}
#2672 How... How did they{03}open the door to{03}Venus Lighthouse?{02}{00}
#2673 They are already...{03}headed for{05} Babi{03}Lighthouse...{02}{00}
#2674 Babi's soldiers are{03}all Colosso victors...{01}How could anyone beat{03}all of us?{03}Who were they?{02}{00}
#2675 Uhnnn... If only I could{03}move...{01}The lighthouse is open{03}at last, but{05}{05} at what{03}cost?{02}{00}
#2676 Their powers were so...{03}strange...{03}Who were they...?{02}{00}
#2677 I must get inside{05}{03}Venus Lighthouse... Must{03}find the connection...{02}{00}
#2678 The young boy seemed to{03}glow for an instant...{01}Then the entrance to{03}Venus Lighthouse opened.{02}{00}
#2679 They weren't in Venus{03}Lighthouse very long.{01}They were heading north{03}toward Babi Lighthouse{03}when I last saw them.{02}{00}
#267A I thought I recognized{03}one of them...{01}An alchemist who served{03}Babi... Was it Kraden?{02}{00}
#267B Kraden told them to stop,{03}but they attacked anyway.{01}Attacking scholars...{03}how vicious!{02}{00}
#267C Kraden went inside, but{03}then came back and said{03}this isn't the entrance.{01}But we've searched the{03}lighthouse, and there's{03}no other entrance.{02}{00}
#267D I thought I'd explore{03}after the door opened.{01}While I was searching{03}this room, Kraden and the{03}others appeared.{02}{00}
#267E They did something to{03}the statue that made{03}the floor light up.{02}{00}
#267F If Kraden hadn't been{03}there, we surely would{03}have been killed.{02}{00}
#2680 Kraden said something{03}about this being the{03}exit...{01}I wonder what he's{03}discovered...{02}{00}
#2681 I wonder what mysteries{03}the statue holds...{01}Kraden said the statue{03}indicated the true{03}path, but how?{02}{00}
#2682 There are words carved{03}into the relief...{01}If ye seek to climb{03}Venus Lighthouse, first{03}seek the power within.{01}To obtain this power, see{03}with the eyes of truth.{03}Then the way shall open.{01}But the path I reveal is{03}not the beginning.{01}The true beginning lies{03}down ancient pathways{03}on distant soils.{02}{00}
#2683 ={00}
#2684 ={00}
#2685 ={00}
#2686 ={00}
#2687 The true road can only{03}be known by he who bears{03}a true heart.{02}{00}
#2688 The statue speaks to{03}{11}{01}'s soul...{01}Ye who seek to climb{03}Venus Lighthouse, I{03}shall grant thy wish.{01}The path long closed{03}shall not be opened here.{01}That path begins far,{03}far away, on the soil{03}of an ancient people,{01}with the sunrise to{03}your left as you gaze{03}upon the lighthouse.{02}{00}
#2689 The statue speaks to{03}{11}{01}'s soul...{01}Ye who seek to climb{03}Venus Lighthouse must{03}seek the lady's leave.{01}Then the way shall open.{03}The lady will keep safe{03}at her feet{01}the place that you seek{03}as she awaits your{03}arrival.{02}{00}
#268A The statue speaks to{03}{11}{01}'s soul...{01}Ye who seek to climb{03}Venus Lighthouse, the{03}lady knows your desires.{01}Here, your path shall{03}not be opened.{02}{00}
#268B The statue seems to{03}speak to your soul...{02}{00}
#268C Red shines{03}northwest{03}of me.{02}{00}
#268D Yellow shines{03}northeast{03}of me.{02}{00}
#268E Red shines{03}due west{03}of me.{02}{00}
#268F Violet shines{03}southeast{03}of me.{02}{00}
#2690 Violet shines{03}southeast{03}of me.{02}{00}
#2691 Hmmm. We can't push the{03}block farther than this.{02}{00}
#2692 It'd be great if we{03}could carry that block and{03}drop it to the ground.{01}Can our Psynergy help{03}us at all?{02}{00}
#2693 It seems to be locked.{02}{00}
#2694 More of Tolbi's soldiers{03}lay defeated...{02}{00}
#2695 Is this more of{03}their work?{1E}{00}
#2696 That voice... It's{03}Iodem...{02}{00}
#2697 You survived!{02}{00}
#2698 We suffered great{03}losses...{02}{00}
#2699 Were you fighting{05} a{03}group of six people?{02}{00}
#269A There were...{05}seven...{02}{00}
#269B You've survived as well!{02}{00}
#269C There were seven? Is{03}this the same group you{03}were following before?{02}{00}
#269D I'm certain of it.{03}One of them must have{03}been...{11}{07}.{02}{00}
#269E {11}{07}, you say...{03}Is this true!?{02}{00}
#269F The scholar Kraden was{03}protecting her. I'm{03}sure it was {11}{07}...{02}{00}
#26A0 Did you hear that, {11}{01}?{03}What do they want with{03}{11}{07}?{02}{00}
#26A1 {11}{07}... They all...{02}{00}
#26A2 Once they finished with{03}us, they headed for{03}Babi Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#26A3 What do they hope to find{03}at Babi Lighthouse?{02}{00}
#26A4 They spoke of the ruins{05}{03}beneath the lighthouse...{02}{00}
#26A5 Ruins? Of course!{03}The foundations of the{03}lighthouse!{02}{00}
#26A6 And Faran, the master{03}of the Lalivero, followed{03}them into the ruins...{02}{00}
#26A7 I see. Faran, too...{02}{00}
#26A8 {11}{01}! We must head for{03}Babi Lighthouse as well.{02}{00}
#26A9 Are you concerned{03}about these soldiers?{02}{00}
#26AA We're fine...{03}You must hurry to{03}the lighthouse.{02}{00}
#26AB The lighthouse... {11}{07}...{03}If anything happens...{03}Just hurry...{02}{00}
#26AC Even the soldiers insist,{03}{11}{01}! Come on!{02}{00}
#26AD {09}{04}Uhhnn...{07} We were{03}taken by surprise...{01}But why...{03}{11}{07}...{02}{00}
#26AE They were terrible!{03}We were no match...{03}They're horrible!{02}{00}
#26AF {09}{04}Ohh...{07} They took {11}{07}{03}and headed for the{03}ruins.{02}{00}
#26B0 {11}{07} is our only hope.{03}If something happens to{03}her, Lalivero is finished.{02}{00}
#26B1 This all happened because{03}Tolbi took {11}{07}{03}away from us...{02}{00}
#26B2 Faran followed {11}{07}.{03}I'm sure he'll{03}rescue her.{02}{00}
#26B3 The rumbling at the{03}ruins must have been{03}a warning...{02}{00}
#26B4 There was an earthquake{03}at the ruins before{03}this happened.{01}I wonder if {11}{07} and{03}the others are okay...{02}{00}
#26B5 If I were bigger, I{03}would have saved{03}{11}{07} myself!{02}{00}
#26B6 I bet {11}{07} can use{03}her powers to escape{03}them.{02}{00}
#26B7 We haven't been ordered{03}to start working yet...{03}Do we get today off?{02}{00}
#26B8 There were strange folk{03}going to the ruins...{03}Faran followed them.{02}{00}
#26B9 It's odd that Babi would{03}build a lighthouse in{03}a place like this.{01}Maybe he thought{03}using the ruins as the{03}foundation would be easy.{02}{00}
#26BA Cutting these stones and{03}stacking them on the{03}ruins isn't easy.{01}Build it faster, you{03}say? Try building it{03}yourself, then!{02}{00}
#26BB If only they didn't{03}have {11}{07}...{01}But even without her{03}as a hostage, we couldn't{03}have beaten them.{02}{00}
#26BC They used fire on us!{03}That's just not right!{02}{00}
#26BD Curses! We couldn't stop{03}{11}{07} and the others...{02}{00}
#26BE What do they plan to do{03}with {11}{07} in the ruins...{01}No... I must not{03}think such horrible{03}things...{02}{00}
#26BF We never should have{03}let Tolbi take {11}{07}{03}away from us.{02}{00}
#26C0 Faran still does not{03}return... What could{03}be happening?{02}{00}
#26C1 We have seen many omens{03}of bad things to come.{01}We saw one when {11}{07}{03}was taken from Lalivero,{03}too...{02}{00}
#26C2 The stones we stacked{03}for the lighthouse{03}won't fall, will they?{02}{00}
#26C3 I tried to step in front{03}of them to save her...{01}But my heart was{03}trembling...{03}I couldn't stop them...{02}{00}
#26C4 They all have a lesson{03}coming to them.{01}They'll learn why {11}{07}{03}is called the holy{03}child of Lalivero!{02}{00}
#26C5 There was a big fight{03}that ended in some{03}hostages being taken.{01}Tragic, I know, but{03}anything that gets me off{03}work can't be all bad!{02}{00}
#26C6 If Faran went after them,{03}then this is serious!{01}If this keeps up, we{03}won't be able to{03}build the lighthouse.{02}{00}
#26C7 Why would they want to{03}rush construction on{03}the lighthouse?{01}Maybe they hope to rule{03}the seas and control{03}more distant lands...{02}{00}
#26C8 Now that I think of it,{03}we did find a strange{03}cave in the quarry.{02}{00}
#26C9 Of course I have seen{03}{11}{07}{1B} power...{03}It's incredible!{01}How could one with{03}such power ever be{03}taken hostage?{02}{00}
#26CA There are some who do{03}not believe {11}{07}{03}has any powers...{01}Doubting {11}{07}?{03}That is foolish!{02}{00}
#26CB Could Faran have{03}tricked us all?{01}If {11}{07} does have mystic{03}powers, she couldn't have{03}been taken hostage.{02}{00}
#26CC If {11}{07} can't use her{03}powers in a time like{03}this, they're useless!{02}{00}
#26CD {11}{07} came flying to{03}the ruins like a{03}shooting star.{01}She created a massive{03}depression in the{03}center of the ruins.{02}{00}
#26CE Even {11}{07} couldn't{03}have escaped six of{03}them...{02}{00}
#26CF They say a man named{03}Iodem is coming from{03}Tolbi.{01}I guess he plans to{03}make us do even{03}more work!{02}{00}
#26D0 No one's called me, so{03}maybe I'll take a nap...{02}{00}
#26D1 {11}{07} said the cave{03}at the ruins leads{03}to the southeast.{01}But it couldn't possibly{03}lead all the way to{03}Venus Lighthouse...{02}{00}
#26D2 The ruins that form the{03}lighthouse foundation{03}are riddled with caves.{01}If you could get through{03}the caves, I'm sure you'd{03}solve the ruins' riddle.{02}{00}
#26D3 We received {11}{07} from{03}the sky and raised her{03}lovingly...{01}I know Faran will{03}rescue that child.{02}{00}
#26D4 I just know that Father{03}will save my elder{03}sister, {11}{07}.{02}{00}
#26D5 His wife seems very calm,{03}considering.{01}Deep down, she must be{03}worried about {11}{07}.{02}{00}
#26D6 {11}{07}, if the power that you{03}showed us is real, then{03}please escape!{01}If you don't, I...might{03}start to doubt that{03}power of yours.{02}{00}
#26D7 {11}{07} is the savior{03}of Lalivero. There's no{03}mistake about it.{01}I don't know of anyone{03}other than {11}{07} with{03}power like that.{02}{00}
#26D8 A legendary savior{03}will appear in the sky...{01}I was a fool for believing{03}that savior was {11}{07}.{02}{00}
#26D9 I'd like to believe in{03}{11}{07}...{01}Please, {11}{07}, use your{03}power to escape from{03}them!{02}{00}
#26DA Even though she fell{03}out of the sky, she{03}wasn't even bruised!{01}They can't hurt{03}{11}{07}!{02}{00}
#26DB If something happens to{03}{11}{07}, what will become{03}of Lalivero?{02}{00}
#26DC When Iodem gets here,{03}he's going to have{03}some explaining to do.{01}I wonder if I should{03}flee Lalivero...{02}{00}
#26DD It's been so long since I{03}had a nap, I'd forgotten{03}how nice they are!{02}{00}
#26DE I wonder how {11}{07}{03}knew about the caves{03}at the ruins?{01}Her visions...{03}they can't be true.{02}{00}
#26DF Those caves are too{03}dangerous for me to{03}explore.{01}If only I were a warrior.{03}Then I'd go find the{03}treasure in the caves!{02}{00}
#26E0 It's so painful to{03}even think of anything{03}bad happening to {11}{07}.{01}I would take her place{03}if I could.{02}{00}
#26E1 I just wish someone{03}would please rescue my{03}sister, {11}{07}.{02}{00}
#26E2 That couple raised {11}{07}{03}as though she were{03}their own child.{01}When someone like {11}{07}{03}is kidnapped, it worries{03}us all!{02}{00}
#26E3 {11}{07} was taken{03}hostage, and Faran{03}went after them?{1E}{00}
#26E4 Oh my! What's everyone{03}else in Lalivero doing?{01}If I didn't have to{03}watch my shop, I'd go{03}rescue {11}{07} myself!{02}{00}
#26E5 What are you, a shut-in?{03}That's all anyone{03}has been talking about!{02}{00}
#26E6 The Laliverans are a{03}timid people, so you can't{03}count on them here.{02}{00}
#26E7 You're a warrior, right?{03}Please rescue {11}{07}!{01}I'll give you a discount{03}on my goods if you{03}rescue her.{02}{00}
#26E8 I can't  rescue {11}{07}!{03}If I only had courage...{03}Maybe then...{02}{00}
#26E9 I guess it was people{03}from Angara who took{03}{11}{07} hostage.{01}Everyone knows that{03}continent is full of{03}thugs and barbarians.{02}{00}
#26EA If anything happens to{03}{11}{07}...{01}I'll never do business{03}with anyone from{03}Angara again!{02}{00}
#26EB If you want to stay, I'll{03}let you, because it{03}means money for me.{01}But if you're a warrior...{03}You ought to be{03}rescuing {11}{07}.{02}{00}
#26EC Oh, I'm sorry...{02}{00}
#26ED I'm so worried about{03}{11}{07}, I can't{03}concentrate.{02}{00}
#26EE But no matter how much{03}I worry, there isn't{03}anything I can do.{02}{00}
#26EF ...Now, to work,{03}to work!{02}{00}
#26F0 Working like this{03}keeps my mind occupied.{02}{00}
#26F1 We must obey Tolbi...{03}That's what led to{03}this happening to {11}{07}.{01}Babi is responsible{03}for all of it!{02}{00}
#26F2 Why did this have to{03}happen to {11}{07}? If{03}only it were a dream.{02}{00}
#26F3 Housecleaning...{03}changing sheets...{03}It's all done, right?{01}I'm just not myself...{03}Sometimes I don't even{03}know what I'm doing...{02}{00}
#26F4 Once this incident is over,{03}I hope Tolbi's soldiers{03}all leave town...{02}{00}
#26F5 You mustn't keep{03}me from my work!{02}{00}
#26F6 Babi isn't building a{03}lighthouse{18}it's a{03}tower...{01}Maybe he is trying to{03}elevate himself to{03}the level of the gods.{02}{00}
#26F7 I bet Babi's tower{03}will be struck down!{01}After all, "pride{03}goeth before a fall!"{02}{00}
#26F8 Babi's most precious{03}belonging is kept here.{01}No one may enter!{02}{00}
#26F9 I wonder what Babi's{03}most precious{03}belonging is...{01}If I don't even know, how{03}can I be interested{03}in guarding it?{02}{00}
#26FA They were{05} terrible!{03}We were absolutely{03}no match for them.{02}{00}
#26FB Only two of those six{03}ever attacked anyone...{01}but just those two{03}completely overwhelmed{03}us!{02}{00}
#26FC They just kicked us out{03}of their way and went{03}on to the lighthouse.{02}{00}
#26FD They set fire to{03}everything! That's why the{03}ground is scorched.{01}Using fire as a{03}weapon is so cowardly!{02}{00}
#26FE We're the ones who{03}attacked, but we took{03}all the damage.{01}What were we thinking,{03}trying to fight those{03}guys?{02}{00}
#26FF The other four didn't{03}seem to have any fight{03}left in them at all.{02}{00}
#2700 What could they be{03}planning for{03}Babi Lighthouse?{02}{00}
#2701 None of them had{03}any torches.{01}It's like that{03}fire just appeared{03}out of nowhere!{02}{00}
#2702 You're sure they went{03}through this door?{02}{00}
#2703 Yes, they opened the{03}stone door and entered!{02}{00}
#2704 Well? Does the door open?{02}{00}
#2705 It's hopeless.{03}It won't budge...{02}{00}
#2706 Of course not!{03}I told you, this{03}door doesn't open!{02}{00}
#2707 If it did open, we would{03}have gone in long ago{03}to study the ruins.{02}{00}
#2708 But I'm certain they{03}went through this door!{02}{00}
#2709 And I'm saying no one{03}has ever gone through{03}here...{02}{00}
#270A Oh! Iodem...{02}{00}
#270B Faran!{02}{00}
#270C I am{05} so sorry about{03}{11}{07}...{02}{00}
#270D Why did this sort of{03}thing have to happen?{02}{00}
#270E Are {11}{05} and the{03}others beyond{03}this door?{02}{00}
#270F Yes. Beyond the door{03}that no normal man{03}can open...{02}{00}
#2710 If they got through, then{03}we can, too. Right?{1E}{00}
#2711 Will you go for us?{02}{00}
#2712 There is no one else{03}who can go after{03}them.{02}{00}
#2713 Iodem, just who are{03}these people?{02}{00}
#2714 They come from the far{03}north.{01}They have chased the ones{03}who took {11}{07} all{03}the way here.{02}{00}
#2715 They've been chasing that{03}fearsome group?{02}{00}
#2716 Yes. They are most{03}fearsome.{02}{00}
#2717 Such awful power... And{03}what they're trying to{03}do seems very dangerous.{02}{00}
#2718 We're the only ones who{03}can stop them.{02}{00}
#2719 You think you can{03}stop them?{1E}{00}
#271A You seem quite sure of{03}yourself, but what do you{03}think you can do?{02}{00}
#271B Hmph! Not with that{03}attitude, you can't!{02}{00}
#271C I have never heard such{03}harsh words from you,{03}Faran.{02}{00}
#271D What do you expect when,{03}in the midst of such{03}dangers...{01}you ask me to leave{03}{11}{07}'s fate in the{03}hands of children?{02}{00}
#271E If you want me to trust{03}them, they must give me{03}reason to trust them!{02}{00}
#271F First, you will have to{03}demonstrate your{03}powers to us.{02}{00}
#2720 Can you follow the same{03}paths that they took?{1E}{00}
#2721 Your confidence means{03}nothing unless you show{03}that you can do it.{02}{00}
#2722 Well, you have no choice...{03}You will have to try.{02}{00}
#2723 Iodem asks only that{03}you stand back{03}and watch.{02}{00}
#2724 Now, show me what you{03}can do.{02}{00}
#2725 I am counting on you,{03}{11}{01}! Prove your worth{03}by opening that door!{02}{00}
#2726 When I saw them, they{03}had already gone through{03}to the other side.{01}It's the truth!{03}You have to believe me!{02}{00}
#2727 I am sorry, but not even{03}{11}{07} has ever passed{03}through here.{01}There is no way this{03}door will open.{02}{00}
#2728 This all started when{03}{11}{07} was dragged{03}off to Tolbi.{01}If anything happens to{03}{11}{07}, the good folk of{03}Lalivero won't sit idly by!{02}{00}
#2729 If you can open this door,{03}I will trust Iodem once{03}more...{02}{00}
#272A I do not mean to doubt{03}your abilities, {11}{01},{03}but I am very worried!{01}If this door doesn't{03}open...{02}{00}
#272B Nobody thinks the door{03}can be opened, and I'm{03}starting to doubt myself.{01}It's not like I{03}actually saw them go{03}through...{02}{00}
#272C I don't know what they're{03}waiting for. If they're{03}going to open the door,{01}they'd better{03}do it now!{02}{00}
#272D This is all a huge waste{03}of time!{01}If we don't find{03}{11}{07} soon, her life{03}may be in danger...{02}{00}
#272E I hope they can open the{03}door, but I won't believe{03}it until I see it.{02}{00}
#272F The door!{02}{00}
#2730 I don't believe it!{03}The door opened!{02}{00}
#2731 Incredible! It really{03}does open.{02}{00}
#2732 How in the world did you{03}open the door?{02}{00}
#2733 I don't know how to{03}explain it...{02}{00}
#2734 We did it because{05}{05}{03}we're us!{02}{00}
#2735 It would take too long{03}to explain.{02}{00}
#2736 There's no time for{03}an explanation,{03}anyway.{02}{00}
#2737 That's right. We must{03}rescue {11}{07}!{02}{00}
#2738 Let's go, Faran. We've{03}got to save {11}{07}!{02}{00}
#2739 Hey, the door's closing!{02}{00}
#273A Why did it close?{02}{00}
#273B I don't know...{03}Why does anything{03}close?{02}{00}
#273C It closed to prevent{03}people with no Psynergy{03}from entering!{02}{00}
#273D It would be perilous for{03}those without Psynergy to{03}try to get through.{02}{00}
#273E I agree! You'll have{03}to let us handle it{03}from here!{02}{00}
#273F What? You're telling us{03}to stay back?{1E}{00}
#2740 Since we can't even open{03}the door, we'd just be{03}getting in your way.{02}{00}
#2741 It won't stop you, but if{03}we can't open the door,{03}we can't go with you.{02}{00}
#2742 This is true...{02}{00}
#2743 But we can't leave {11}{07}{03}in their hands just{03}because it's dangerous.{02}{00}
#2744 They have greater power{03}than you can even{03}imagine.{02}{00}
#2745 And without such power,{03}this door will not open{03}for us?{1E}{00}
#2746 That is how it seems.{02}{00}
#2747 The power they just{03}displayed is but a fraction{03}of their true might.{02}{00}
#2748 Without that sort of{03}power, we would just{03}get in their way.{02}{00}
#2749 I understand. {11}{07}'s{03}life is in your hands.{02}{00}
#274A Do not fail us. You must{03}bring {11}{07} safely{03}back!{02}{00}
#274B Make haste, {11}{01}.{03}All our hopes lie with{03}you!{02}{00}
#274C I beg of you, {11}{01}.{03}Please bring {11}{07}{03}back!{02}{00}
#274D I can't believe this{03}door actually opened!{03}What are you?{02}{00}
#274E It takes great courage{03}to continue on in the{03}face of danger...{01}We will be here{03}awaiting your safe{03}return.{02}{00}
#274F I'm very interested in{03}what lies beyond here.{01}I know! Once this is{03}over, I'll go see{03}for myself!{02}{00}
#2750 I am not afraid of{03}danger, but I do not{03}want to hinder you.{01}I am counting on you{03}to save {11}{07} for us.{02}{00}
#2751 If anything happens to{03}{11}{07}, Tolbi will become{03}Lalivero's sworn enemy.{01}That must be{03}prevented at all costs.{02}{00}
#2752 If this door opens, maybe{03}we can get into other{03}parts of the ruins too.{02}{00}
#2753 I bet the monsters around{03}here are nothing{03}like what lies ahead!{01}I'm happy to leave such{03}dangers to these{03}warriors.{02}{00}
#2754 This is a big waste{03}of time...{01}{11}{07}'s life is in{03}danger! If they don't{03}find her soon...{02}{00}
#2755 I don't want to hinder{03}{11}{07}'s rescue!{01}From here on out,{03}I'm leaving everything{03}to these warriors...{02}{00}
#2756 The truth of this door{03}is open to those seeing{03}with their true heart.{02}{00}
#2757 At long last, the time{03}has come to light Venus{03}Lighthouse's beacon.{02}{00}
#2758 With the second beacon{03}lit, only two will remain.{02}{00}
#2759 No. Lighting Jupiter is{03}virtually the same as{03}lighting Mars.{02}{00}
#275A That is true. Jupiter is{03}really all that remains.{02}{00}
#275B That's right. Your dreams{03}are within your grasp{03}now.{02}{00}
#275C Why are you still here,{03}{11}{05}?{02}{00}
#275D I thought I ordered you{03}on ahead to the ship.{02}{00}
#275E I've already sent{03}{11}{06} and the others to{03}the dock at Idejima.{02}{00}
#275F Then why did you come{03}back?{02}{00}
#2760 Because I have a{03}different promise to{03}keep.{02}{00}
#2761 A promise, you say?{02}{00}
#2762 You must mean {11}{07}...{02}{00}
#2763 Yes, {11}{07}. Why haven't{03}you released her yet?{02}{00}
#2764 You promised to free{03}her once you got into{03}Venus Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#2765 And that's what brought{03}you back here?{02}{00}
#2766 You promised not to{03}involve anyone who wasn't{03}related to this matter.{02}{00}
#2767 {11}{07} is special.{02}{00}
#2768 Of course...{02}{00}
#2769 Because {11}{07} is a{03}special Adept?{02}{00}
#276A You guys learned{03}something from the{03}first two lighthouses.{02}{00}
#276B And what would that be?{02}{00}
#276C In order to enter each{03}lighthouse, you needed an{03}Adept of that clan.{02}{00}
#276D Right now, we have Fire,{03}Earth, and Water Adepts,{05}{03}but no Wind Adept.{02}{00}
#276E That does seem{05}{03}to be the case.{02}{00}
#276F Do we need {11}{07} to{03}get into the Jupiter{03}Lighthouse?{02}{00}
#2770 I'm sorry, {11}{05}, but we{03}cannot even enter without{03}a Wind Adept.{02}{00}
#2771 That being the case, I{03}guess I understand why{03}you can't set {11}{07} free.{02}{00}
#2772 It seems that you, too,{03}have learned something.{01}If that is all, then{03}you should go, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
#2773 No. I cannot leave{03}{11}{07} behind!{02}{00}
#2774 I'm taking {11}{07}{03}to the ship!{02}{00}
#2775 What are you talking{03}about, {11}{05}?{02}{00}
#2776 We don't know what will{03}happen when you light this{03}beacon.{01}I won't leave {11}{07}{03}here to find out!{02}{00}
#2777 We told you that we'd{03}protect {11}{07}. Don't{03}you trust us?{02}{00}
#2778 That's not what I'm{03}saying...{05} It's just{03}best to be safe.{02}{00}
#2779 Don't tell us what's{03}best, {11}{05}. You're{03}not taking {11}{07}.{02}{00}
#277A Why not?{05}{05} What?{05}{03}You don't trust me?{02}{00}
#277B How can we, after you{03}just demanded we free{03}{11}{07}?{02}{00}
#277C If we had trusted you{03}a moment ago, {11}{07}{03}would be free now.{02}{00}
#277D Come with me, {11}{07}!{03}I shall protect you!{02}{00}
#277E Are you ready to do{03}this, even though it{03}means fighting us?{02}{00}
#277F ...I believe he is!{01}He would not have{03}defied us if he lacked{03}the will to fight.{02}{00}
#2780 If it means protecting{03}{11}{07} from harm,{03}then I must.{02}{00}
#2781 You have seen what{03}we can do. You know{03}you can't stop us.{02}{00}
#2782 How can you protect{03}{11}{07}{05}, when you can't{03}even protect yourself?{02}{00}
#2783 This rebellious attitude{03}is exactly why we've{03}never let you fight.{02}{00}
#2784 Haven't you been given{03}enough reason to fear{03}us in these travels?{02}{00}
#2785 You're no fighter, {11}{05}.{03}How can you hope to{03}stand against us?{02}{00}
#2786 You've questioned us for{03}the last time!{05} Let's see{03}what you can do!{02}{00}
#2787 It looks like they're{03}having a falling out{03}over {11}{07}.{02}{00}
#2788 There's something more{03}to it, though...{02}{00}
#2789 It seems Saturos and{03}Menardi no longer{03}trust {11}{05}.{02}{00}
#278A Looks like the perfect{03}opportunity has just{03}fallen into our laps!{02}{00}
#278B Now's our only chance to{03}prevent them from{03}lighting the beacon!{1E}{00}
#278C There's not a moment to{03}spare!{05} Let's move!{02}{00}
#278D Don't chicken out now!{03}If we hesitate, they'll{03}light the beacon!{02}{00}
#278E {11}{01}...{02}{00}
#278F So!{05} You've come{03}to stop us?{02}{00}
#2790 Look what your defiance{03}has brought us, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
#2791 I don't need you or{03}anyone to rescue{03}me, {11}{01}!{02}{00}
#2792 I was just about to{03}settle things with{03}Saturos and Menardi...{01}You can watch!{02}{00}
#2793 And then we'll show you{03}the true power of this{03}beacon's light!{02}{00}
#2794 But...{11}{07} has{03}nothing to do with this!{03}So set {11}{07} free!{02}{00}
#2795 Silence!{05} You'd best tread{03}lightly, {11}{05}, or both{03}you and {11}{07} will suffer!{02}{00}
#2796 If anything happens{03}to {11}{07}, we will have{03}failed Faran...{02}{00}
#2797 We won't permit you{03}to lay a hand on{03}{11}{07} or {11}{05}!{02}{00}
#2798 Oh ho! So you're{03}worried about {11}{07},{03}too?{02}{00}
#2799 Don't worry. We won't{03}hurt {11}{07}...{05}if you{03}meet our conditions.{02}{00}
#279A What are you doing,{03}Saturos?{02}{00}
#279B Leave this to me!{02}{00}
#279C {11}{07}!{05} Do you{03}remember the rod{03}connected to Hesperia?{02}{00}
#279D The Rod of Hesperia?{02}{00}
#279E The rod required to{03}reach the Jupiter{03}Lighthouse!{02}{00}
#279F Ye{05}-Yes...{02}{00}
#27A0 Those who pursue us{03}bear a rod...{03}Is it the one?{02}{00}
#27A1 {11}{07}! Stay where you{03}are! You can do it{03}from there!{02}{00}
#27A2 How about it, {11}{07}?{02}{00}
#27A3 Well, {11}{07}?{02}{00}
#27A4 .{05}.{05}.{05}Perhaps{05}.{05}.{05}.{02}{00}
#27A5 "Perhaps..."{05}{03}Perhaps what!?{02}{00}
#27A6 Don't yell at her!{02}{00}
#27A7 We're not yelling!{05}{03}We just want a{03}straight answer.{02}{00}
#27A8 So, {11}{07}?{02}{00}
#27A9 Their minds are veiled.{03}I cannot see clearly...{05}but{03}I think...{05}it's the one.{02}{00}
#27AA It's a waste to{03}make her try again.{02}{00}
#27AB So, what do we do?{02}{00}
#27AC Do you know the terms{03}we will require before we{03}agree not to harm {11}{07}?{1E}{00}
#27AD You're smarter than{03}I thought if you've{03}already figured it out.{02}{00}
#27AE I want the rod that{03}will get us into{03}Jupiter Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#27AF If you give us the{03}Shaman's Rod, {11}{07} will{03}not be harmed. Agreed?{1E}{00}
#27B0 The Shaman's Rod?{05}{03}If it means saving {11}{07},{03}I will give it to you.{02}{00}
#27B1 He wants the Shaman's{03}Rod. If it will save{03}{11}{07}, I'll give it up.{02}{00}
#27B2 What?{05} But Hammet gave{03}that to you, {11}{03}!{02}{00}
#27B3 Don't you care{03}what happens to{03}{11}{07}?{02}{00}
#27B4 Then you will give{03}us {09}{02}the rod!{07}{02}{00}
#27B5 Well done, Saturos!{03}We finally have{03}the Shaman's Rod!{02}{00}
#27B6 Go get it, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
#27B7 Why me?{02}{00}
#27B8 To ensure your{03}loyalty to us!{02}{00}
#27B9 Go on, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
#27BA {11}{01} handed over{03}the Shaman's Rod.{02}{00}
#27BB What should I do{03}with the rod?{02}{00}
#27BC Keep it safe!{02}{00}
#27BD Where do you think{03}you're going, {11}{07}?{02}{00}
#27BE We gave you the rod.{03}Now, release {11}{07}!{02}{00}
#27BF Whatever do{03}you mean?{02}{00}
#27C0 You said you'd free{03}{11}{07} if we gave{03}you the rod.{02}{00}
#27C1 Those{05} were your terms.{02}{00}
#27C2 We gave you the rod,{03}so release {11}{07}!{02}{00}
#27C3 You seem to have{05}{03}misunderstood. I said we{03}wouldn't harm {11}{07}...{01}but I never said{03}we'd let her go!{02}{00}
#27C4 You're altering the{03}bargain?{02}{00}
#27C5 Ha ha! We can't help it{03}if you misinterpreted{03}Saturos's terms!{02}{00}
#27C6 Besides, if we were to{03}release {11}{07}, she'd{03}be in quite a fix.{02}{00}
#27C7 What do you mean?{02}{00}
#27C8 {11}{07} can't get{03}back to Lalivero{03}alone.{02}{00}
#27C9 What do you mean? We're{03}going to take{05} {11}{07}.{05}.{05}.{03}Oh no...{02}{00}
#27CA That's right.{05} You{03}won't be going back.{03}This is it for you!{02}{00}
#27CB Excuse me?{02}{00}
#27CC Enough!{05} You're the{03}ones who aren't going{03}anywhere!{02}{00}
#27CD Bring it on, whelp! You{03}won't live long enough to{03}regret your stupidity!{02}{00}
#27CE Prepare to experience{03}first-hand the horror{03}of a master Fire Adept!{02}{00}
#27CF We did it!{03}We beat 'em!{02}{00}
#27D0 All right, {11}{07}...{05}{03}Let's go!{02}{00}
#27D1 {11}{05}! What are{03}you doing?{02}{00}
#27D2 I cannot give up{03}{11}{07}...{02}{00}
#27D3 What!?{05} But we just{03}saved you!{02}{00}
#27D4 I never asked you{03}to help us...{02}{00}
#27D5 {11}{05}, you're not one{03}of them. You're free to{03}go now...{02}{00}
#27D6 So why are you{03}doing this?{02}{00}
#27D7 The four beacons must{03}still be lit...{02}{00}
#27D8 You're going to light{03}the beacons!? That's{03}ridiculous!{02}{00}
#27D9 I felt you'd say that.{05}{03}But{05} I'm going to do it{03}anyway!{02}{00}
#27DA So, wait... If he means to{03}light the beacons, then{03}he's our enemy, right?{1E}{00}
#27DB Do what you will, {11}{01},{05}{03}but if you try to stop{03}me, I'll fight you.{02}{00}
#27DC Friend or enemy, you{03}won't stop me from taking{03}{11}{07} with me!{02}{00}
#27DD I hope{05} you don't{03}think{05} you've{03}finished us off.{02}{00}
#27DE You may not be{03}finished, but you{03}can barely stand.{02}{00}
#27DF Right now, {05}yes...{05}{03}But we'll be back{03}on our feet...{01}as soon as we do{03}{05}{05}THIS!{02}{00}
#27E0 Oh, no!{05} He threw{03}the Elemental Star{03}into the lighthouse!{02}{00}
#27E1 How could this happen...{03}We couldn't keep them{03}from lighting the beacon!{02}{00}
#27E2 That's not all...{02}{00}
#27E3 The energy of the{03}beacon will restore{03}our power.{02}{00}
#27E4 How can it restore{03}their power? Venus is the{03}earth elemental, right?{1E}{00}
#27E5 Then why would Venus{03}give power to Fire{03}Adepts?{02}{00}
#27E6 Have you forgotten{03}everything we've learned?{03}Venus is earth.{01}It shouldn't be a{03}source of power{03}for Fire Adepts!{02}{00}
#27E7 Fire and earth share{05} a{03}symbiotic relationship.{02}{00}
#27E8 This light will restore{03}our Psynergy!{02}{00}
#27E9 We'll fight you as many{03}times as it takes.{03}We won't lose.{02}{00}
#27EA You may have beaten{03}the two of us...{02}{00}
#27EB But{05} now, you face the{03}true might of Fire{03}Clan of the north!{02}{00}
#27EC Fire Clan of{03}the north?{02}{00}
#27ED Bear witness to the{03}true strength of the{03}northern wilds!{02}{00}
#27EE Oh, give it up!{03}We beat you once,{03}we'll do it again!{02}{00}
#27EF Go, {11}{05}!{03}Take {11}{07} and go!{02}{00}
#27F0 I can...{05}go?{02}{00}
#27F1 We may not have the{03}strength to protect {11}{07}{03}after this.{02}{00}
#27F2 You must take {11}{07} to{03}the ship without fail!{02}{00}
#27F3 What are you waiting for?{03}Go! Now!{02}{00}
#27F4 No. I cannot leave{03}you to fight them{03}alone.{02}{00}
#27F5 Are you saying you{03}don't want to lose to{03}{11}{01}?{02}{00}
#27F6 I wonder if{03}that's true...{02}{00}
#27F7 What was that?{02}{00}
#27F8 Wouldn't you be just a{03}little sad to see your{03}childhood friend perish?{02}{00}
#27F9 What are you saying?{02}{00}
#27FA I'm saying you're{03}here to protect this{03}brat from your past.{02}{00}
#27FB Do you really think{03}that I{05} would help{03}them?{02}{00}
#27FC Let's just say that{03}I wouldn't put it{03}past you.{02}{00}
#27FD And you, Saturos?{05}{03}Do you agree?{02}{00}
#27FE I wouldn't say that...{05}{03}But it would be best not{03}to raise our suspicion.{02}{00}
#27FF Now, who's telling whom{03}what's best? Fine! I'll{03}take {11}{07} for you!{02}{00}
#2800 Come on,{05} {11}{07}!{02}{00}
#2801 Wait, {11}{05}! I won't{03}let you go!{02}{00}
#2802 Heh heh... {11}{05} is the{03}least of your worries{03}right now.{02}{00}
#2803 Oh my{18}{05}they're glowing!{02}{00}
#2804 It's time you learned{05}{03}what true power is!{02}{00}
#2805 Their Psynergy is{03}overflowing!{02}{00}
#2806 Hya ha ha!{05}{03}It's too late{03}to run!{02}{00}
#2807 Uh-oh...{03}They're fusing!{02}{00}
#2808 They've merged into one{03}another! Everyone{03}get back!{02}{00}
#2809 How...{05} How...{03}did we lose?{02}{00}
#280A We are superior in{03}every way{05}, but still{03}we were defeated...{02}{00}
#280B We did it! We won!{02}{00}
#280C We beat them...{05}but have{03}we really won?{1E}{00}
#280D Even though we couldn't{03}stop the beacon from{03}being lit?{02}{00}
#280E All our efforts were{03}for naught.{02}{00}
#280F What are you{03}talking about?{02}{00}
#2810 We did everything{03}we could!{02}{00}
#2811 Sure we couldn't save{03}the Venus Lighthouse,{03}but...{02}{00}
#2812 We beat them! They're{03}gone! You saw them fall{03}down into the pit...{02}{00}
#2813 So we don't have to{03}worry about any more{03}beacons being lit!{02}{00}
#2814 But {11}{05} is gone,{03}and he's taken {11}{07}...{02}{00}
#2815 What's with you guys?{03}{11}{01}... What are you{03}lookin' at?!?{02}{00}
#2816 {11}{05}!{02}{00}
#2817 Did you{05}{05} finish them?{02}{00}
#2818 No one knew their power{03}better than I did.{03}If you destroyed them...{02}{00}
#2819 Then I am no match{03}for you now, {11}{01}...{01}I must go...{02}{00}
#281A Come, {11}{07}!{02}{00}
#281B Wait, {11}{05}!{02}{00}
#281C Why do you run from us?{02}{00}
#281D They fell into the{03}lighthouse. It's all{03}over!{02}{00}
#281E Poor fools...{05} If you think{03}it's over, you are{03}sadly mistaken!{02}{00}
#281F If you plan to light the{03}other beacons, you will{03}still need...{02}{00}
#2820 The Elemental Stars?{03}We have them!{02}{00}
#2821 They're gone, {11}{05}!{03}You don't have to light{03}the beacons anymore...{02}{00}
#2822 Yes, I do.{05} If I don't{03}light the beacons...{02}{00}
#2823 What will happen?{02}{00}
#2824 It's no use talking{03}about it...{05}{03}Just wait and see!{02}{00}
#2825 If you won't release{03}{11}{07}, we'll have{03}to take her back!{02}{00}
#2826 The lighthouse...!{02}{00}
#2827 {11}{01}!{05} They're too{03}far away! We can't reach{03}{11}{05}!{02}{00}
#2828 That's not all! There's{03}light coming from{03}down below!{02}{00}
#2829 Noooo!{05} {11}{07}!{02}{00}
#282A Hold on, {11}{07}!{03}Take my hand!{02}{00}
#282B I can't...{02}{00}
#282C You must try!{03}If you don't,{03}you'll fall!{02}{00}
#282D Look down...{05}{05} The{03}foundations of the{03}lighthouse are crumbling!{02}{00}
#282E Why is this happening?{03}Is it to protect{03}Venus Lighthouse?{02}{00}
#282F I'm{05} slipping...{05}{05}{03}I can't{05}{05} hold on{05} any longer.{02}{00}
#2830 Nooo!{05} Don't let go!{03}You can't! You'll...{02}{00}
#2831 Good-bye, {11}{05},{03}{05}{05}and thank you.{02}{00}
#2832 {09}{02}{11}{07}!!!{07}{05} No!{03}I won't let you die!{02}{00}
#2833 !!!{02}{00}
#2834 {11}{07} fell after that{03}last tremor...{02}{00}
#2835 {11}{05} didn't dive into{03}the sea after her,{03}did he?{02}{00}
#2836 I can't believe he{03}did that from so{03}high up!{02}{00}
#2837 You idiot, {11}{05}!{05} I can't{03}believe he said he'd{03}light the other beacons.{02}{00}
#2838 We would have had to{03}fight him if this hadn't{03}happened...{02}{00}
#2839 But he sacrificed{03}himself to save {11}{07}.{03}He's not like Saturos.{02}{00}
#283A I'm at a loss, {11}{01}.{03}We have to decide{03}what to do next.{02}{00}
#283B What to do?{05}{03}What {09}{02}can{07} we do?{02}{00}
#283C What about {11}{06} and{03}the others at Idejima?{02}{00}
#283D Oh yeah!{05} I completely{03}forgot about {11}{06}!{02}{00}
#283E {11}{01}! Listen up!{05} We've{03}got to find {11}{06}!{02}{00}
#283F Look at that!{05} {11}{01}{03}has finally come back{03}to his senses!{02}{00}
#2840 Shouldn't we go find{03}{11}{06} and the others{03}right away?{1E}{00}
#2841 It's about time you{03}started agreeing with{03}me!{02}{00}
#2842 {11}{01}, you'll have to tell{03}{11}{06} about {11}{05}.{02}{00}
#2843 I know it will be hard,{03}but you'll be there to{03}comfort her.{02}{00}
#2844 After all this, you don't{03}have the guts to tell{03}{11}{06} about {11}{05}?{02}{00}
#2845 If you don't tell her{03}what happened to {11}{05},{03}then who will?{02}{00}
#2846 You're going to have{03}to find a way to{03}console {11}{06}...{02}{00}
#2847 What's the matter, {11}{02}?{02}{00}
#2848 I was just thinkin'...{05}{05}{03}How the heck are we{03}supposed to get down?{02}{00}
#2849 Good point.{05} This is{03}going to make leaving{03}very difficult...{02}{00}
#284A It's back to normal!{02}{00}
#284B That was odd...{03}What's going on{03}around here?{02}{00}
#284C I don't think we'll{03}ever know.{02}{00}
#284D At least now, we can{03}go search for {11}{06}{03}and the others.{02}{00}
#284E All right{05}, let's go,{03}{11}{01}!{05} It's time to find{03}{11}{06}.{02}{00}
#284F But despite a long and{03}tiring search, {11}{06} was{03}nowhere to be found.{02}{00}
#2850 How did the search for{03}{11}{07} turn out?{02}{00}
#2851 We were{05} unable to{03}find any sign of her.{02}{00}
#2852 The seas are too rough{03}to search.{02}{00}
#2853 And there's no sign{03}of her on land...{02}{00}
#2854 Tolbi is responsible for{03}{11}{07}'s fate.{02}{00}
#2855 No apology can reflect{03}the sorrow I feel at{03}your loss, Faran...{02}{00}
#2856 All we can do for{03}{11}{07} now is...{03}hope.{02}{00}
#2857 But tell me, what of{03}{11}{06} and the{03}others?{02}{00}
#2858 The same. We've searched{03}all over, but they're{03}nowhere to be found.{02}{00}
#2859 The ground tore apart{03}from the shock of the{03}lighthouse, and the ship...{02}{00}
#285A Apparently, everything at{03}Idejima, including the{03}ship, was swept away...{02}{00}
#285B So, Idejima itself{03}was washed out{03}to sea?{1E}{00}
#285C Incredible... Then the{03}cave, too, has been{03}flooded?{02}{00}
#285D But we think {11}{06}{03}and the others are{03}still alive.{02}{00}
#285E They may have been{03}washed out to sea{03}with Idejima.{02}{00}
#285F We have decided to{03}continue searching for{03}{11}{06}.{02}{00}
#2860 Haven't we,{03}{11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#2861 Do not worry about{03}{11}{07}. I just hope you{03}are able to find {11}{06}.{02}{00}
#2862 You need not worry about{03}{11}{07}...{02}{00}
#2863 We will find {11}{07}{03}without fail...{02}{00}
#2864 {11}{07} has been in{03}dangerous situations{03}before and lived.{02}{00}
#2865 But this time, I believe{03}it was nothing short{03}of a miracle...{02}{00}
#2866 Who knew the sea would{03}rise up to the lighthouse{03}just as she fell?{02}{00}
#2867 Can you really call{03}that a miracle?{02}{00}
#2868 Do you think it was just{03}good luck?{02}{00}
#2869 Let's call it mere{03}coincidence, for now.{02}{00}
#286A Nothing is coincidental{03}when it comes to this{03}child.{02}{00}
#286B So, you believe...{03}{11}{07} survived...?{02}{00}
#286C Yes. I am sure of it.{02}{00}
#286D Just because {11}{07}{03}...was an Adept?{02}{00}
#286E An Adept...{03}What is that?{02}{00}
#286F Well, it's...{02}{00}
#2870 It's someone with abilities{03}like theirs.{02}{00}
#2871 {11}{01}, you and your{03}friends are truly amazing.{02}{00}
#2872 You were able to enter{03}the ancient ruins and get{03}to Venus Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#2873 But {11}{07} was{03}different. She couldn't{03}enter the ruins.{02}{00}
#2874 That's just because{03}{11}{07}'s abilities{03}are different from theirs.{02}{00}
#2875 No matter how many times{03}I explain that to Faran...{03}He doesn't get it!{02}{00}
#2876 {11}{02}, don't be rude...{02}{00}
#2877 Unfortunately, we don't{03}have time to talk.{03}We've got to go!{02}{00}
#2878 That's right. I didn't{03}mean to keep you...{02}{00}
#2879 That didn't come{03}out right...{02}{00}
#287A We mean that while we're{03}talking, {11}{06} and the{03}others are lost at sea.{02}{00}
#287B I understand your{03}desire to leave as{03}soon as possible.{02}{00}
#287C The seas have been very{03}rough since the beacon{03}was lit. Be careful!{02}{00}
#287D You, too. Farewell.{02}{00}
#287E Take care...{03}and farewell!{02}{00}
#287F Thank you very much. I{03}hope your search for{03}{11}{07} yields success.{02}{00}
#2880 But tell me, what of{03}{11}{06} and the{03}others?{02}{00}
#2881 The same. We've searched{03}all over, but they're{03}nowhere to be found.{02}{00}
#2882 The ground tore apart{03}from the shock of the{03}lighthouse...{02}{00}
#2883 And then Idejima was{03}swept out to sea...{02}{00}
#2884 My goodness... Then...{03}{11}{06} and the others{03}must have...{02}{00}
#2885 {11}{05} said at the{03}lighthouse that he sent{03}{11}{06} ahead to the ship.{02}{00}
#2886 But we think they{03}survived.{02}{00}
#2887 They may have been{03}washed out to sea{03}with Idejima...{02}{00}
#2888 So, we have decided to{03}continue searching for{03}{11}{06}.{02}{00}
#2889 Haven't we,{03}{11}{01}?{1E}{00}
#288A You will find {11}{06}.{03}I know it...{03}Farewell.{02}{00}
#288B Please wait for me{03}outside Faran's house.{03}I wish to speak with you.{02}{00}
#288C So, there are good folk{03}like {11}{01} and his{03}companions in Angara.{01}Ah... If only I were{03}younger... I would travel{03}to Angara myself...{02}{00}
#288D I must explain their{03}promise to Lord Babi,{03}before it's too late!{02}{00}
#288E Where are you going,{03}{11}{01}? Iodem asked us{03}to wait. Did you forget?{1E}{00}
#288F We're going to need{03}to work on your memory,{03}{11}{01}.{02}{00}
#2890 I know we need to leave,{03}but we should hear{03}what Iodem has to say.{02}{00}
#2891 We can delay our{03}departure a little{03}longer. Let's wait.{02}{00}
#2892 Thank you for waiting{03}for me.{02}{00}
#2893 As you no doubt have{03}guessed, I need to speak{03}with you about Lemuria.{02}{00}
#2894 Yes, the island of the{03}ancients far out{03}to sea.{02}{00}
#2895 When you could not find{03}{11}{06}, you returned to{03}Venus Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#2896 Yeah. The base of the{03}lighthouse was flooded,{03}so we couldn't get out.{02}{00}
#2897 And that's when you{03}gazed out to sea, as you{03}promised Babi you would.{02}{00}
#2898 Yes... And we saw an{03}area wrapped in mist.{02}{00}
#2899 I remembered how Babi{03}said Lemuria was always{03}covered in mist.{02}{00}
#289A I am not sure, but I{03}am beginning to think{03}that may be Lemuria...{02}{00}
#289B If it is, then{03}Babi's life...{02}{00}
#289C ...could be saved? Yes.{02}{00}
#289D Then I guess we have{03}no choice but to go...{1E}{00}
#289E Good. Then it's settled.{03}I'll make arrangements for{03}you to leave at once.{02}{00}
#289F You swore an oath.{03}It is meaningless unless{03}you go immediately.{02}{00}
#28A0 But...we have to find{03}{11}{06} first...{02}{00}
#28A1 That is the other reason{03}I wanted to see you...{03}to give you this.{02}{00}
#28A2 Iodem takes out{03}the Black Orb.{02}{00}
#28A3 Oh, isn't that...{02}{00}
#28A4 You will need it to{03}sail Babi's ship.{02}{00}
#28A5 Babi told me the ship of{03}the ancients is an{03}incredible vessel.{02}{00}
#28A6 It will make your search{03}for {11}{06} easier.{02}{00}
#28A7 We appreciate it.{02}{00}
#28A8 But I want you to find{03}Lemuria as soon as{03}possible.{02}{00}
#28A9 We promised Babi we{03}would find Lemuria.{03}We will not fail him.{02}{00}
#28AA {11}{01} got the Black Orb.{02}{00}
#28AB The ship is docked at{03}the edge of town. You will{03}know it when you see it.{02}{00}
#28AC Farewell! And bring back{03}news of Lemuria!{02}{00}
#28AD Right on, {11}{01}!{03}We finally get to see{03}the ocean!{02}{00}
#28AE To sea we go!{02}{00}
#28AF It is time to depart.{02}{00}
#28B0 I thought the ship we saw{03}at Idejima was Babi's...{02}{00}
#28B1 His ship is here{03}in Lalivero.{02}{00}
#28B2 So the ship at the{03}peninsula was Saturos's{03}ship!{02}{00}
#28B3 Perhaps, but we have{03}no way of finding{03}that out now...{02}{00}
#28B4 Yes...{05} They're gone...{02}{00}
#28B5 But now we can sail{03}the ship of the ancients!{02}{00}
#28B6 It certainly will aid us{03}in our search for {11}{06}.{02}{00}
#28B7 Where are you going?{03}Aren't we taking{03}Babi's ship?{01}Then we should head to{03}that wharf the soldier{03}in town was guarding.{02}{00}
#28B8 I was told to let you{03}in if you showed up...{01}The door is open.{02}{00}
#28B9 Apparently, a ship has{03}been docked here all{03}this time...{01}It must be a very{03}special ship.{02}{00}
#28BA This sure seems like a{03}strange place for Babi{03}to moor his yacht.{02}{00}
#28BB Ha ha! I thought they had{03}done me in for sure,{03}but I'm all better now.{02}{00}
#28BC I will never let my{03}guard down again.{01}We will be the ones to{03}protect Lalivero from{03}danger...{02}{00}
#28BD Where could {11}{07} be{03}now? I'm so worried.{02}{00}
#28BE Are you leaving{03}Lalivero?{1E}{00}
#28BF I do not know where you{03}are headed, but wherever{03}it is, you will do fine.{02}{00}
#28C0 You are staying?{01}Splendid! Me and all the{03}Laliverans will feel{03}much safer.{02}{00}
#28C1 I saw the beacon of{03}Venus Lighthouse{03}light up...{01}It was one of the most{03}beautiful sights I{03}have ever seen...{02}{00}
#28C2 The explosion in the{03}Venus ruins caused Babi{03}Lighthouse to crumble.{01}The works of man can{03}never withstand such{03}mystical power.{02}{00}
#28C3 The peninsula behind{03}Venus Lighthouse{03}is flooded...{01}The powers of the{03}ancients are fierce!{02}{00}
#28C4 I can't believe you{03}escaped Venus Lighthouse.{01}What? The tunnel under{03}the lighthouse is not{03}flooded? So that's how{01}you came back, huh?{02}{00}
#28C5 If you defeated that evil{03}bunch, you must be{03}mighty warriors!{02}{00}
#28C6 {11}{07} jumped into the{03}ocean from atop the{03}lighthouse? Unbelievable!{02}{00}
#28C7 No trespassing.{03}Danger beyond{03}this point.{02}{00}
#28C8 I am all healed now, but{03}I lost all my confidence{03}after being beaten.{01}Even if I return to{03}Tolbi, I will never{03}fight again.{02}{00}
#28C9 I wanted to be a part{03}of the battle at{03}Venus Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#28CA If {11}{07} used her great{03}powers{05}, then she must{03}still be alive.{01}But surviving such{03}rough seas must be{03}very difficult.{02}{00}
#28CB After everything that's{03}happened, Lalivero no{03}longer feels safe.{02}{00}
#28CC Venus Lighthouse has been{03}the symbol of Lalivero{03}since the olden days...{01}The lighting of the beacon{03}may be a sign of good{03}things to come...{02}{00}
#28CD Iodem of Tolbi doesn't{03}seem too disappointed{03}about Babi Lighthouse...{01}It must have just{03}been another whim of{03}that tyrant, Babi...{02}{00}
#28CE The ocean is so rough{03}since the peninsula{03}was washed away.{01}They say one strange{03}event invites another...{03}leading to great disaster.{02}{00}
#28CF Venus Lighthouse is{03}still standing strong{03}despite what happened.{01}It must have been{03}built by the gods...{02}{00}
#28D0 You must be great{03}warriors to defeat{03}them...{01}Can I become{03}your apprentice?{02}{00}
#28D1 {11}{07} would be fine{18}{03}even after falling from{03}such a height...{02}{00}
#28D2 The continent broke apart{03}around the lighthouse,{03}and the lands beyond it{01}are now far from the{03}continent of Gondowan.{03}Will they ever return?{02}{00}
#28D3 What happened to those{03}living on the other{03}side of the lighthouse?{02}{00}
#28D4 I shudder to think what{03}would happen if our town{03}was washed out to sea.{02}{00}
#28D5 We're lucky that we live{03}north of the lighthouse.{01}If we didn't, we{03}wouldn't have made it.{02}{00}
#28D6 Everyone says that{03}{11}{07} is okay...{03}Is that true?{02}{00}
#28D7 I realized how thoughtless{03}I was after what{03}happened...{01}Lalivero needs {11}{07}.{02}{00}
#28D8 If she is indeed the{03}child of the gods,{03}she will survive.{02}{00}
#28D9 We want to believe in{03}something at times{03}like this.{01}If we had {11}{07} now,{03}I could have relied on{03}her.{02}{00}
#28DA {11}{07} should be fine.{03}She was fine when{03}she fell from the sky.{01}The height of the{03}lighthouse is nothing{03}to her!{02}{00}
#28DB {11}{07} will wake when the{03}beacon in Venus{03}Lighthouse is lit.{01}Then, Lalivero will be{03}free from Tolbi's{03}grip...{02}{00}
#28DC Seeing {11}{07} dive must{03}have been beautiful...{02}{00}
#28DD I can't wait until{03}{11}{07} is back.{01}All of Lalivero is{03}awaiting her return.{02}{00}
#28DE Babi Lighthouse crumbled{03}when all the lands shook.{01}No one can enter now{03}because it is too{03}dangerous inside.{02}{00}
#28DF I always wanted a break,{03}but being on vacation{03}all the time is no fun.{02}{00}
#28E0 So the ruins really are{03}connected to Venus{03}Lighthouse. I knew it!{01}What {11}{07} said was{03}true!{02}{00}
#28E1 You finally solved{03}the mystery of the ruins...{01}I had no idea these ruins{03}were connected to{03}Venus Lighthouse.{02}{00}
#28E2 Will they continue on,{03}or quit now that Babi{03}Lighthouse has crumbled?{02}{00}
#28E3 I'm worried that we won't{03}get paid now that the{03}construction has ended.{02}{00}
#28E4 We can't possibly dig a{03}hole from here to Venus{03}Lighthouse.{01}It must have been very{03}difficult for those{03}who made this tunnel.{02}{00}
#28E5 The mystery of the{03}ruins should have{03}remained a mystery.{02}{00}
#28E6 Faran says knowing her{03}powers, {11}{07} is alive{03}without a doubt.{01}But I can't be as sure{03}as Faran until I see{03}her.{02}{00}
#28E7 You are leaving after{03}all, aren't you...{01}You are welcome in{03}Lalivero anytime.{02}{00}
#28E8 They say the lighthouse{03}crumbled down.{03}That's as it should be.{02}{00}
#28E9 You will find {11}{06}{03}someday. Farewell.{02}{00}
#28EA {11}{01}, that boat belongs{03}to you now.{01}Do not hesitate to use{03}it any way you wish.{02}{00}
#28EB I don't need fame or{03}fortune...{05} I just want{03}{11}{07} to be safe.{01}{11}{07}...{02}{00}
#28EC Why won't anyone stop{03}{11}{01} and his friends{03}from leaving us?{02}{00}
#28ED Tolbi is to be blamed{03}for what happened to{03}{11}{07}!{01}Tolbi should be{03}cursed and destroyed!{02}{00}
#28EE So there are some people{03}like {11}{01} and his{03}friends in Angara...{01}If only I were a{03}little younger...{03}I'd go to Angara...{02}{00}
#28EF Please use that ship to{03}find Lemuria, the land{03}that Lord Babi sought.{02}{00}
#28F0 I went to the ocean to{03}look for {11}{07} today,{03}but it was so rough.{02}{00}
#28F1 No one could{03}possibly swim in an{03}ocean that rough.{02}{00}
#28F2 We wanted to send ships{03}out to sea to find {11}{07},{03}but we can't yet.{01}The ships would{03}all capsize in the{03}rough waters.{02}{00}
#28F3 When will the ocean{03}be calm again?{02}{00}
#28F4 It is impossible to go{03}out on the ocean now. Be{03}careful when you do.{01}The Champa who rule the{03}seas are frightful{03}people. Beware.{02}{00}
#28F5 The Champa are people{03}from a coastal village{03}in Angara.{02}{00}
#28F6 I didn't know it at the{03}time, but that loud noise{03}was the sound of the{01}beacon being lit. The inn{03}guests all became{03}scared and ran outside.{02}{00}
#28F7 I must say, it is nice{03}to see the light of{03}the beacon at night.{02}{00}
#28F8 Fishing is so difficult{03}nowadays because the{03}ocean is so rough.{01}We have little to cook{03}when we can't fish.{03}That's no good for us!{02}{00}
#28F9 Why would the lighting{03}make such a loud{03}noise?{01}Was that the noise{03}of that star-like thing{03}above the lighthouse?{02}{00}
#28FA I'm sleepy. These bright{03}nights have been keeping{03}me up late.{02}{00}
#28FB Gee... What am I{03}going to cook{03}for dinner tonight?{02}{00}
#28FC Babi Lighthouse was{03}struck down, just as I{03}knew it would be.{02}{00}
#28FD First, the lighthouse was{03}struck down. Next, Babi{03}himself will be punished.{02}{00}
#28FE It looks like it's{03}finally time to{03}leave Gondowan.{02}{00}
#28FF It's so strange...{03}We've been traveling{03}for so long,{01}and yet it feels like{03}we've only just begun.{02}{00}
#2900 Now that I think about{03}it, so many things{03}have happened.{02}{00}
#2901 But our journey will be{03}over as soon as we{03}find {11}{06}, right?{1E}{00}
#2902 The end of one journey,{03}but the beginning of{03}another? No way!{02}{00}
#2903 What did you say?{03}Our next journey?{03}What journey is that?{02}{00}
#2904 You didn't forget,{03}did you, {11}{02}?{02}{00}
#2905 Our promise to Babi.{02}{00}
#2906 Oh... Lemuria!{02}{00}
#2907 I wonder what kind of{03}place Lemuria is.{02}{00}
#2908 We have to find{03}{11}{06} before going{03}to Lemuria, don't we?{1E}{00}
#2909 Yeah. That's important.{02}{00}
#290A Huh? {11}{06}'s going to be{03}very sad when I tell{03}her what you said!{02}{00}
#290B At any rate, this will{03}be our first time on{03}the ocean.{02}{00}
#290C So this is the ocean{03}Kraden wanted me to see.{02}{00}
#290D The seas are very rough.{03}Do you think we will{03}be okay?{1E}{00}
#290E This is a Lemurian ship.{03}We'll be fine.{02}{00}
#290F I guess it's hard{03}to say. Still, we must{03}go, just the same...{02}{00}
#2910 Well... Shall we, then?{02}{00}
#2911 To sea...{02}{00}
#2912 {11}{06} is waiting{03}for us!{02}{00}

#2914 I don't know...{03}I wish you could{03}tell me.{02}{00}

#2919 I can't be certain,{05} but{03}it looks like they lit{03}the Venus beacon.{02}{00}
#291A You don't have to tell me{03}that. That's how we wound{03}up adrift at sea, right?{02}{00}
#291B You are so cranky{03}today, {11}{06}!{02}{00}
#291C Well,{05} I suppose you{03}must be worried about{03}{11}{05}.{02}{00}
#291D {11}{01} and his friends{03}must have been{03}nearby, too.{02}{00}
#291E They probably were...{02}{00}

#2958 Hey, are you trying{03}to get away from it?{01}Well... I will win{03}on my own. Just watch!{02}{00}
#2959 What? {11}{01}? You are{03}not going to fight?{02}{00}
#295A I will do my best to{03}cover {11}{01}'s share.{02}{00}
#295B ?{00}
#295C Don't be lazy!{02}{00}
#295D I wonder who the next{03}opponent is... I can't{03}wait. Right, {11}{01}?{02}{00}
#295E I will do my best, but{03}can you cover me when{03}I need it, {11}{01}?{02}{00}

#2971 {11}{01}, it's not my{03}fault we lost.{01}We need to work on our{03}teamwork. Let's try{03}harder next time!{02}{00}
#2972 I'm sorry we lost.{01}I think they read{03}our game plan.{02}{00}
#2973 Maybe I am not{03}so good in battle...{02}{00}
#2974 ?{00}
#2975 We lost!{02}{00}
#2976 I knew it. You lost{03}because you left{03}me out!{02}{00}

#297F Up to three allies{03}can fight in Linked{03}Battle finals.{01}The results vary greatly{03}depending on who you{03}set what Djinn to.{02}{00}
#2980 That was a great{03}battle..{03}What excitement!{02}{00}
#2981 Too bad. Sometimes, you{03}have to be lucky to win.{03}Don't be too disappointed.{02}{00}
#2982 Is this the Battle Arena{03}the old man spoke of?{03}I thought it was a{01}story of dreams. Or is{03}this the old man's{03}dream?{02}{00}
#2983 Wow... You guys.{03}You are much stronger{03}than you look.{02}{00}

#2985 I am a traveling warrior.{03}I came here to become{03}stronger...{01}Listen to me on{03}this: Don't underestimate{03}the monsters here...{02}{00}

#2991 To use Summon quickly,{03}Djinn must be on{03}standby.{01}But to improve your class,{03}Djinn must be set...{03}Hmm... Choices, choices...{02}{00}
#2992 Do you put Djinn on{03}standby before a battle,{03}or do you set them?{01}I usually set them to{03}raise my class before{03}I fight.{02}{00}
#2993 Remove Djinn you rarely{03}use so you can{03}summon quickly.{01}I'm impatient, so I{03}prefer to fight in{03}short battles.{02}{00}
#2994 All the warriors are{03}impressive, so I get edgy{03}before battles begin.{02}{00}
